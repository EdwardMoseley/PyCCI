Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization  [**2200-3-7**]
[**2200-3-11**] CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to DIAG)


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 year old male with CAD s/p MI with DES to
LAD in [**2196**] c/b ISRS in [**2196**] (re-stent) and [**4-/2199**] (BMS x3) and
DES to proximal LAD in [**9-/2199**], rapid atrial tachycardia s/p
AVNRT ablation, DM2, ESRD on HD (last done yesterday), and PVD
s/p partial left foot amputation.  He reports that he developed
a productive cough on [**2200-3-3**].  He did not have any fevers or
chills.  Later that night, he developed substernal chest pain
and pressure like ""an elbow pressing in the chest"" up to [**6-17**] in
intensity.  He denied any associated dyspnea, nausea, vomiting,
or diaphoresis.  The pain resolved with SLNG, but recurred the
next morning shortly before his PCA arrived.  He has had anginal
chest pain in the past with a similar quality, but not as
severe.  He continued to have chest pain, and was brought to the
[**Hospital3 417**] ED.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] on [**2200-3-4**], where he was found
to have hyperkalemia and Troponin elevation with peak 43.71.
His CXR reportedly showed ""mild congestion.""  He was started on
a Heparin drip.  His pain resolved and he had no further
complaints of chest pain, but did have dyspnea getting up to the
commode.  He was transferred here today for cardiac
catheterization.  Vital signs prior to transfer were T 98.9, HR
68 (SR with LBBB), BP 117/62, RR 22, and SpO2 98% on RA.  At the
OSH, he was also noted to be intermittently incontinent of
stool.
.
Cardiac catheterization today was attempted with a right radial
approach, but was unsuccessful, and was converted to a right
femoral approach.  The cath showed 3VD and no intervention was
performed.  He is now being evaluated for possible CABG.  On
arrival to the floor, he was CP free and reported no pain or
tenderness at the cath site.  He continued to have a somewhat
productive cough.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, significant
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.  He does
report DOE, and is able to walk less than 150 ft and climb less
than one flight of stairs before becoming SOB at baseline.
.
On further review of systems, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He has had a clot
removed from his dialysis fistula in the past.  He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF=25-30 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque . There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function ( EF = 30-35%)
2. Mitral regurgitation is moderate now
3. Unchanged tricuspid regurgitation

Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation
Radial arterial line insertion

History of Present Illness:
58y/o RHM with history of liver transplant, Hepatitis C, chronic
renal disease and multiple asymptomatic strokes, presented with
sudden decline in his mental status. His wife witnessed him be
struggling get out from bed, decline in his
awareness. His wife spoke to him with appropriate condition
around 6:05PM. Around 6:25PM, she heard that the patient started
to say non-sence, act inappropriately, unable to exchange
conversation. His wife recalled some ""shaking"" at the right arm.
He was brought into [**Hospital1 18**] ED above time and Neurology was
consulted for code stroke.

In ED, while Neurology was examining patient, he developed right
arm, leg clonic seizure with head deviation and gaze deviation
toward to left. He responded with moan when his name was called,
then developed left arm clonic seizure (secondary
generalization) and became unresponsive. Ativan 2mg IV was given
to stop. Patient was intubated subsequently to have further
neuroradiological evaluation.

HPI ADDENDUM:
Further history was obtained from the patient's wife the morning
following his admission. She reports the patient was well until
returning from a same-day-surgical procedure on [**10-14**] for repair
of left eye retinal detachment. The patient was vague with his
reported symptoms, but complained of ""feeling lousy"" with poor
appetite and fatigue. He did not eat or drink very much Friday
or Saturday following. On Saturday evening he began to vomit
quite frequently. They had a small breakfast Sunday morning and
the patient was still feeling unwell, but altogether normal per
his wife. She left for a few hours during the day, returned home
and heard him yelling out of frustration after having dropped
something in his room, however the yelling continued and she
went to see him and noted that he had a great amount of
difficulty getting himself upright to the edge of his bed. She
then noted his right arm was shaking. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where the above described event occurred.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2809**] is a 58 year old gentleman s/p liver transplant
related to chronic HCV infection, myopathy (? steroid induced),
history of prior multiple asymptomatic embolic infarcts prior to
transplantation, who presents with three day prodrome of general
malaise, poor appetite, nausea/vomiting, followed by acute
change in mental status with witnessed partial complex seizure
in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

1) Neuro:
* SEIZURE - Initially a code stroke was called in the ED, but CT
imaging and later, MRI, showed no evidence of acute infarction.
Initial labs notable for presence of only serum benzodiazepines
on tox screening and acute on chronic renal failure. Etiology of
seizure was thought to be areas of prior cortical infarcts in
setting of gastrointestinal illness. The patient was intubated
in the emergency department and promptly extubated at 2am in the
Neuro ICU the same evening. The morning following admission the
patient's examination was notable for marked encephalopathy. He
was changed from phenytoin to oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) given
multiple long term side effects of phenytoin, and with normal
hepatic function, but renal impairment and keppra did not seem a
wise choice. Lumbar puncture was attempted with light sedation
without success. It was re-attempted with fentanyl and midazolam
for monitored conscious sedation and revealed 1 WBC, 0 RBC,
normal protein and glucose. He was transferred to the floor
after an EEG done on the [**7-18**] revealed no
abnormalities and showed a normal background.
* ENCEPHALOPATHY - On the floor, the patient's exam was notable
for continued encephalopathy, but he was evidently not
delerious. His main abnormalities were frontal dysfunction (as
exhibited by impulsiveness, stimulus-bound behaviors,
desinhibition, bilateral grasp and palmomental reflexes, a
marked inability to switch mindset) and memory (as exhibited by
anososgnosia, orientation to place and time, as well as not
imprinting new information, and working memory (the patient
stayed in-task, and had sufficent attention to perform, but
couldn't complete the tasks). Clinically he continued to improve
slowly but surely, an EEG done on [**10-21**] showed 7 Hz background,
but otherwise normal. Per his wife, his level of cognitive
functioning at home was high, as for example he was able to
discuss politics.

2) Cardio:
* NSTEMI - Patient was noted to have elevated troponin enzymes
to 0.31 with EKG without ischemic changes. He was started on
aspirin, beta blocker, atorvastatin. Cardiology consultation was
obtained and additionally recommended echocardiogram which
revealed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, no
focal wall motion abnormalities (poor data quality though),
LVEF>55%, mild aortic valve stenosis. His NSTEMI was thought
related to demand related ischemia in the setting of
catecholamine surge associated with seizure. He should be
scheduled for an exercise stress test as an outpatient.

3) FEN
* Acute Renal Failure - Patient's has prior hepato-renal
syndrome now with baseline creatinine of 1.9-2. Admission
creatinine notable for 2.4. He was noted to have low urine
output. He received vigorous IV hydration with improved Cr to
1.6, however this was likely a sampling error because all the
lines of his cellcount were down on this blooddraw as well,
repeat labs showed a creat of 2.0 and his [**Hospital1 **] back to the old
values. His medications were renally dosed. He was started on
Thiamine, Folate and MVI.

4) Liver transplantation
Transaminase levels on admission were WNL. Hepatology
consultation was obtained and recommended continuing with his
prior regimen of immunosuppressive agents. No changes were made.


5) ID
A broad spectrum of CSF studies were sent despite the normal
cell count. Varicella PCR and CMV PCR negative, remainder
pending. MRSA isolation negative. VRE swab negative.
Cryptococcal antigen GRAM STAIN, FLUID CULTURE, FUNGAL
CULTURE-PRELIMINARY,ACID FAST CULTURE, VIRAL CULTURE were all
(preliminary) negative.

6) PPx, reactivation and reconditioning
For prophylaxis, he was put on Heparin, pneumoboots, TEDs, and
PT and OT were consulted to evaluate and treat him.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Complex partial seizure with secondary generalization.

Discharge Condition:
Stable, improving cognitively.

Discharge Instructions:
You have been admitted with an epileptic seizure, most likely
related to small scars in your brain from old small strokes,
possibly in the setting mild dehydration. After this you have
been confused for a while, which is not unusual with a fragile
brain, a post-seizure state and a lot of medications on board.
Your medications such as Remeron and Methylphenidate have been

Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with a PMH s/f type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with
prior episodes of DKA in the past, complicated by and NSTEMI in
[**8-/2111**], biventricular CHF, severe PVD s/p recent femoral bypass
for an ischemic right foot, and current cocaine abuse.  Last
night, her father noted her to have a decreased appetite, and
""changes in her body language"" consistent with past
presentations of hyperglycemia.  She went to sleep and woke up
at 3AM with extreme hunger.  At that time he checked a finger
stick, and noted it to be critically high.  He spoke to the
[**Last Name (un) **] coverage, who recommended administering her 75/25 and
sliding scale, and to continue monitoring.  When her finger
sticks and mental status did not change, he brought her to the
ED.  She has not had any fevers, chills, night sweats, URI
symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Her parents note severe pain
in both of her legs, which is chronic ""phantom limb pain"" and
neuropathy.  She had a dry cough this morning, but this is
chronic.
.
On arrival to the ED she was afebrile, hypotensive with an SBP
of 88, HR=86, RR=18, O2 sat 100%.  She was A+Ox2, and complained
of left knee (phantom) pain.  Her exam was notable for dry
gangrene on her right foot.  Labs showed a blood sugar of 744, a
bicarbonate of 8, an anion gap of 30, ABG 7.12/30/106/10.  She
was given a 7 unit bolus of insulin, followed by 7units/hour
infusion, and a 2L NS bolus.  Labs were otherwise notable for a
creatinine of 3.5 (from a baseline of 1), flat cardiac enzymes,
leukocytosis to 19.8, thrombocytosis to 714, tox screen positive
for cocaine, and a contaminated UA.  CXR was clear, EKG is not
done, CT head pending, blood and urine cultures were sent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right
femoral bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered
mental status secondary to DKA.

#. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The etiology of the patient's DKA was
thought to be medication noncompliance in the setting of
polysubstance abuse, as her tox screen was positive for cocaine
and she had no evidence of acute infection or cardiac ischemia.
A UA and CXR were nonfocal.  She was aggressively rehydrated
with normal saline, receiving approximately 6L in the ED and
overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Her respiratory status was followed
closely, given her history of bisystolic dysfunction.  She was
also initially managed with an insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr
(0.1units/kg/hr) until her blood sugar fell below 250 and her
anion gap closed, at which point she was started on an ISS.  Her
anion gap did widen to 17 on hospital day #2, [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted, and she was transitioned back to insulin gtt
overnight.  Then with closed gap, she was transitioned back to
[**Hospital1 **] nph 18 and 24.  Her finger stick glucose, lytes, and pH were
monitored closely, and potassium was repleted prn throughout her
ICU course.  Patient was transferred to floor on [**Hospital1 **] sq insulin,
with glucoses <150, and stable vital signs.  On the floor she
had some episodes of hypoglycemia (BS 40s).  The patient did not
eat as much as she should at meals because ""I don't like the
food here.""  Patient was given juice and crackers and blood
sugar returned to the normal range.  Her Humalog 75/25 was
reduced to her home dose of 15units qam and 20units qpm.  She
was instructed to follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.
.
# Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration,
as evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.  Her Cr
improved to 1.7 after intravascular volume repletion.  She was
also continued on nephrocaps and her medications were renally
dosed.
.
#. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine,
prior OMR notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.  [**Name (NI) **]
home regimen of metoprolol was held given the risk of unopposed
alpha agonism in setting of beta blockade.
.
#. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction:  Monitored
closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia.  Her
BB and lisinopril were held in the setting of hypotension and
ARF, but restarted before [**Name (NI) **].
.
#. Chronic Pain: Her home regimen of oxycodone was held until
her mental status cleared.  It was resumed at [**Name (NI) **].
.
#. Anxiety/depression:  Concintued clonazepam and lorazapam once
mental status cleared.
.
# Peripheral vascular disease:  The pt is s/p left BKA.  THe
patient had a recent bypass graft on the right and it was found
that to have gone down.  Vascular surgery was consulted.  Per
their note: ""There does not appear to be any acute
limb-threatening ischemia of the R foot.  There is no evidence
of RLE infection as the cause of her hyperglycemia or altered
mentalstatus.""  A follow up appointment was arranged with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].
.
ACCESS: Access was difficult to obtain.  Pt needed RIJ placed.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32675**] is a 64 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension,
and chornic thrombocytopenia who initially presented to
[**Hospital1 **]
with a two day history of falls and dysarthria and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when she was found to have a right
basal
ganglia hemorrhage in the setting of a platelet count of 43.
.
The patient explains that she last felt well on Friday, two days
prior to admission.  One day prior to admission she started
falling; she thinks that she generally fell toward the left.
Although there was no loss of consciousness, she did strike her
head during at least one of the spills.  She also started to
drop
items from her left hand.   On the evening prior to admission,
she reportedly sent her friend a non-sensical email with letters
strung together in non- English words.  On the day of admission,
the patient's friend called her to see how she was faring and
discovered the patient's speech was slurred.  Accordingly, the
friend called 911.  The patient was initially taken to
[**Hospital1 **].
After a non-contrast CT of the head demonstrated right basal
ganglia hemorrhage, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and care.

Pertinent Results:
MR head [**2200-7-21**]

. Large acute-subacute intraparenchymal hematoma in the right
basal ganglia with surrounding edema and mild leftward shift of
the midline structures and mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle, not significantly changed compared to the recent CT
study. Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left
parietal lobe, corresponding to the previously noted hemorrhage
on the CT.


2. 5 x 5 mm saccular, lobulated aneurysm in the region of the
confluence of the A1 and A2 segment sof the right anterior
cerebral artery and the anterior communicating artery. However,
it is unclear if this has ruptured given the farther location of
the hematoma. hence, any other aneurysms or vascular lesions
cannot be completely excluded. Consider CT angiogram of the head
for better assessment of this aneurysm and any other
anuerysms/vascular lesions elsewhere and in the hematoma. Rec.
INR consult. Post-contrast MR images can be considered after
resolution of the hemorrhage to exclude an underlying mass
lesion. Findings informed to [**Doctor Last Name **] by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2200-7-22**].

3. Diffuse mucosal thickening/fluid in the left mastoid air
cells.

I7/26/10 US abd.
MPRESSION:
  1. Chronic appearing nonocclusive thrombus involving the
distal splenic
vein/SMV confluence with regions of presumed chronic occlusion
involving
portions of the main portal vein which is diminutive in size.
Some
intrahepatic right portal flow is noted which may relate to
arterial portal shunting or portal collateral vessel formation.
Hepatic veins and arteries remain patent.

2. Mild splenomegaly. Coarsened heterogeneous liver parenchyma
is presumably secondary to hepatitis C.

TTE [**2200-7-21**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32675**] is a 64 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension,
and chronic thrombocytopenia who initially presented to
[**Hospital1 **]
with a two day history of falls and dysarthria and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when she was found to have a right
basal
ganglia hemorrhage in the setting of a platelet count of 43.
You were admitted to the ICU where you had an uncomplicated
course while further workup was made to understand the etiology
of your bleed. You had platlet infusion while in the the ICU.
You had an MRI, TTE, CT head, CXR. You were observed in the ICU
and you had a stable course only requiring frequent close
observation. Your major deficits were imbalance, left hand/arm
numbness and weakness, and dysarthria/dysphagia with a left
facial droop. You were transferred to the floor for further
observation. You had a brief episode of hypotension which
responded to fluid. And we held your anti-hypertensive
medications because of this. Your SBP ranged from the mid 90's
to the 110's. You were evaluated by PT /OT who thought it was
safe for your to return home with home PT/OT and home health aid
which was requested. A call was made to your daughter [**Name (NI) 402**]
to arrange for some supervision while the above home health aid
could be arranged. You and [**Doctor Last Name 402**] stated that it would be best
if the appointments requested were to be made by [**Doctor Last Name 402**] since
she would be the one responsible for transportation. The
etiology of your hemorrhagic stroke is unknown but thought not
to be from hypertension but possibly from platlet dysfunction Vs
amyloid angiopathy.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for having a right basal ganglion bleed that
was discovered at an outside hospital. You had thrombocytopenia
and because of the bleed were given platlet infusion. You had an
troponin bump that was thought to be from cardiac stress but
given bleeding episode along with previous chronic intercranial
pathology consistent with a previous bleed you were not
anticoagulated or placed on aspirin. You have multiple serious
comorbidiites and we contact[**Name (NI) **] your outpatient specialist. You
were borderline hypotensive in the 90-110's systolic. Because of
this we held your aldactone and lasix and while metoprolol 12.5
mg was tried this was stopped because this had an adverse effect
on your blood pressure. We have asked you to stop these
anti-hypertensive medications until you are seen by your [**Name (NI) 3390**].

PRE BYPASS The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being a paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. The thoracic aorta appears
intact. No changes from the prebypass study.
Radiology Report CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of
[**2133-4-18**]
Final Report
HISTORY: CABG. PICC line placement.
There is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent
with
atelectasis or consolidation. The costophrenic sulci are
blunted.
Mediastinal structures are unchanged. A right internal jugular
sheath remains in place. A PICC line has been inserted on the
left and terminates at the level of the cavoatrial junction.
Compared with the previous study
retrocardiac density has increased and blunting of the
costophrenic sulci is new or more apparent.
IMPRESSION: PICC placement as described. Increased atelectasis
or
consolidation in the lower left lung. Evidence for small pleural
effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111**] was a same day admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-4-15**] for
coronary artery bypass grafting. She was taken to the operating
room where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to
three vessels. Please see operative note for details.
In summary she had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to
the first obtuse marginal coronary artery; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from the aorta to the posterior left
ventricular coronary artery.
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.
Her bypass time was 78 minutes with a crossclamp time of 63
minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and post-operatively she was
transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. In the
immediate post-op period she remained hemodynamically stable,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Because the patient is a type 1 diabetic followed by the [**Last Name (un) 387**]
diabetes service they were consulted for assistance in her care
and insulin management. The patient stayed in the ICU for 3
additional days because she required a Phenylephrine infusion to
support her blood pressure. On POD4 she transferred out of the
ICU to the stepdown floor for continued care and recovery from
her surgery. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed.
She was seen by physical therapy and her activity was advanced.
The remainder of her hospital course ws uneventful. On POD6 the
patient was discharged home with visiting nurses. she is to
follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in 4 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 43 yo M with h/o DMI here with hyperkalemia, DKA and groin
ulcer.
.
# Hyperkalemia: This occured in the setting of being on AceI.
Lisinopril held and K trended down to normal. F/U with pcp
regarding restarting lisinopril.
.
# ARF: Cr at the OSH was 2.1. He is down to 1.2 and his baseline
is 1.3-1.6. UA negative. Was probably pre-renal in setting of
DKA and dehydration. Improved with IVF further supporting
prerenal etiology. As blood pressure was normal while off
lisinopril and patient has had hyperkalemia with the lisinopril,
this medication was held and pt should f/u with pcp regarding
restarting this medication.
.
# DMI: Patient admitted to ICU for insulin gtt and IVF as he had
an anion gap [**1-18**] DKA, He had ketones in urine. Likely
precipitant of DKA was infection. Groin ulcer infected with
MSSA.  Patient was transitioned off insulin gtt and transferred
to floor where we resumed his home dose of insulin at 80 units
[**Hospital1 **]. We also continued asa, atorvastatin. He was set up with
[**Last Name (un) 387**] on discharge.

# Groin ulcer- Swab shows mixed flora and MSSA. Pt is s/p
debridement at bedside by general surgery. He was initially
treated with 5 days of IV vancomycin and was discharged on
dicloxacillin on discharge after sensitivities came back.
Dressings were changed [**Hospital1 **] and pt has VNA at home to help with
this. Patient given appointment for surgery follow-up on
discharge.
.
# Foot ulcers- podiatry followed the patient while he was in the
hospital and he has outpatient follow-up set up. Dressings
changed daily.
.
# Leg wounds: Vascular surgery follows these wounds. None of the
leg wounds appeared infected. Dressing changed daily by wound
care nurse. Pt has vascular surgery follow-up after discharge.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia- continued lipitor
.
# Neuropathy- continued neurontin-renally dosed at 300 q 6
hours.

MICROBIOLOGY:

[**2141-4-29**] Abscess aspirate: E. coli (pan-sensitive)

RADIOLOGY:

[**2141-4-28**] CT: There are no stones in the ureters or  urinary
bladder. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
There is a 7.3 x 5.4 cm fluid collection inferior to the cecum,
with adjacent fat stranding. The appendix is not visualized.
These findings likely represent ruptured appendicitis and
periappendiceal abscess. Small bowel loops are normal in
caliber.

[**2141-4-29**] CT: Successful placement of an 8-French self-locking
pigtail catheter within the periappendiceal abscess. The
catheter is open to drainage.

[**2141-5-6**] CT: drainage from JP


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 year old male who was admitted on [**2141-4-28**] with
several weeks of abdominal pain and a CT scan revealing an
appendiceal abscess. This was drained by interventional
radiology on [**2141-4-29**] and an 8-french catheter was left in place.
The patient was toxic-appearing on admission with tachycardia
and low oxygen saturation. He also had an INR of 10 and was on
coumadin at home for peripheral vascular disease, but hadn't had
this checked regularly. He also had an elevated blood sugar of
500. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for management
of these multiple issues . His pain was well controlled with prn
morphine. From a respiratory standpoint, he was well-managed
with nasal cannula oxygen and did not require intubation but was
treated with nebulizers.  His blood sugars were managed
initially with an insulin drip which was then converted to
sliding scale insulin. He was started on empiric levoquin and
flagyl. Prior to the IR drainage, FFP was used to reverse his
elevated INR. He remained stable after his procedure and had no
bleeding complications. On hospital day three he was started
back on a clear diet which he tolerated well. He received lasix
diuresis for congestion in his lungs and edema with good
response. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for diabetes control and assisted
with transition to a sliding scale insulin. He was transfered to
the floor on hospital day 5 and started on a regular diet which
he tolerated well . His hematocrit trended downward although
there was no evidence of an active bleed and he was supported
with 2 units of packed red blood prodcuts on hospital day 5.
Pulmonology consult was obtained and assessed the patient as
having chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and felt he should
continue his home oxygen treatment and transition from
nebulizers here to combivent at home. He was restarted on his
home coumadin on hospital day 6 and was started on a heparin
drip. His INR level was 1.4 on day of discharge and he was
discharged with 5 mg QHS coumadin with planned blood level check
2 days after discharge and appropriate adjustment per PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] CT
scan was obtained on day of discharge which revealed no
remaining undrained abscesses, but his drain was left in place
with planned repeat CT scan within 2 weeks for assessment of any
new fluid collections before removal. He was transitioned off of
IV pain medications to oral pain medications as a discharge
regimen. A visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25472**] to assist with home drain
teaching. Cultures from his fluid aspirate revealed
pan-sensitive E. coli and he was discharged on a 10 day course
of augmentin. He will have follow-ups with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] as well
as [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes and his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] questions were answered to
his satisfaction upon discharge.

Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p stellate ganglion block


History of Present Illness:
67 y/o female with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (possibly
from myocarditis presumed viral >10 years ago) with LVEF of 20%
(non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on
recent echo), BiV ICD, who was admitted to CCU in late [**Month (only) 359**]
for VT ablation following ICD discharges in [**Month (only) **]. During
the procedure, it was found that she has multiple inducible VT's
arising from septum, lateral wall and apex. Ablation attempt not
performed given septal origin of VT. She was discharged home on
Mexiletine rather than Amiodarone. Following that discharge, she
continued to have frequent sustained VT, and was subsequently
readmitted [**10-22**] with more symptomatic VT which was paced and not
shocked. During that admission, she had an EP study and
attempted VT ablation at the anterior septal aspect of the
subaortic valve region. Carvedilol and Mexiletine were held
prior to the procedure. She was then started on Metoprolol and
titrated up to Metoprolol XL 50 mg PO BID. She was observed off
Mexiletine without further significant episodes and discharged
home on [**2114-10-25**].
.
This morning she was walking from her bathroom and felt
palpitations with associated lightheadedness for approximately
30 seconds. Her ICD subsequently fired and then fired again 30
seconds later. Her palpitations resolved
She was observed while she was off the mexiletine with no
significant episodes and sent home [**2114-10-25**]. This AM, she was
walking from her bathroom and felt palpitations and
lightheadedness for approximately 30 seconds. Her ICD fired, and
then fired again 30 seconds later. After the second shock, she
was no longer sympatomatic from her palps. She denied chest
pain/pressure, SOB, nausea during this episode.
.
She was instructed to present to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival, EP
interrogated the device which showed VT at a rate of ~120 BPM,
which was attempted to be broken by ATP twice and ultimately
shocked twice with escalating joules. On arrival to the floor,
she initially felt well without any palpitations or
lightheadedness. She subsequently developed VT to 110s-120s. She
then received Ativan 1 mg IV and Lidocaine 100 mg IV once at
1400 with subsequent resolution of her VT. At 1755 she again
went into VT and recevied Metoprolol 5 m IV once and an
additional 50 mg IV Lidocaine. This episode resolved as well but
40 minutes later she again went into VT and received Fentanyl 25
mg IV and Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The VT again resolved but the
patient was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient was calm and was no longer
in VT. She felt well only reporting a fluttering in her chest
when in VT.

STRESS EKG
INTERPRETATION: This 67 year old woman with LVEF of 20% and
history
of dilated cardiomyopathy and VT was referred to the lab for
evaluation.
The patient exercised for 4.5 minutes of a modified [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]/RAMP

protocol and asked the test be stopped for fatigue. The
estimated peak
MET capacity was 1.5 which represents a poor functional
capacity. No
arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient
throughout the study. The ST segments are uninterpretable for
ischemia
in the setting of the v-paced rhythm. The rhythm was a-v paced
with
rare isolated vpbs. Resting hypotension with a slight increase
in
systolic BP with exercise.
IMPRESSION: No symptoms or sustained ectopy with uninterpretable
ST
segments at the achieved level of exercise.


Brief Hospital Course:
67-year-old woman with an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with
LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation
(improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, recent study for
endocardial/epicardial ablation of multifocal VT that were found
to arise from septum, lateral wall and apex, recently ablated
[**2114-10-25**]. Discharged on toprol XL. Now presenting with recurrent
VT and shocks x2.
.
ACTIVE ISSUE:
# Ventricular tachycardia: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a succesful
stellate ganglion block. After this procedure she did not have
any episodes of VT demonstrating a significant smpathetic
component to her VT. She was also started on Quinidine. She will
follow up with EP to decide on the long term plan as the
stellate ganglion block is not expected to permanently suppress
her arrhythmia.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Chronic, LVEF 20%. NY Class III/IV per

outpt notes which has worsened recently from II. On CHF regimen
including carvedilol, spironolactone, and torsemide.
.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.7 on admission
and trended down to 1.4 on discharge. This appears to be her
baseline per our records.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral Central Venous Line


History of Present Illness:
28 yo F with a history of DM1 c/b gastroporesis presents with
severe abdominal pain. Patient is noncompliant and reportedly
only occasionally takes her BP medications and only some of her
insulin at baseline. Per report, patient was screaming at the
top of her lungs at triage that she had abdominal pain in all 4
quadrants which started upon waking in the morning. This was
associated with nausea and vomitting. She did note missing HD
for the last 2 sessions.
.
In the ED, she was found to have an Anion gap of 25,
hyperglycemia and ketonuria. She was strarted on an Insulin drip
at 7U/hr. She also received 1 L NS, 3 mg of IV Dilaudid, 1mg IV
ativan, 8mg IV Zofran, and 10 mg IV compazine. She was also
given Calcium gluconate for a K of 5.3 and peaked T waves on
EKG. She was hypertensive to ths 190s and was given her PM dose
of labetalol 100 mg po x1. 1 EJ and 2 IJs were attempted
unsuccessfully, so a femoral line was placed. Per nursing notes,
she was noted to be ""sleepy but arousable"" during the repeated
line placements. Repeat FS at 2220 was 71, so Insulin was
reduced to 5 u/hr and D51/2 NS with 20 meq K was started after a
D50 bolus. On transfer, VS were afebrile, 93, 133/86, 14, 96%
RA.
.
On the floor, she is lethargic and barely arousable to sternal
rub. She can tell me she came in with abdominal pain, but then
nods back to sleep. She can not answer orientation questions.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 28 year old female with DM1 and ESRD on HD presenting
with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
.
# Diabetic ketoacidosis-- The patient presented with an anion
gap acidosis (anion gap of 25), glucose of 301, and ketonuria.
The precipitant for the diabetic ketoacidosis was at first
unclear, but after discharge the patient's urine culture
returned positive for enterococcus.  She was called at home and
a prescription for Augmentin 500mg daily was called in for her
to take after her dialysis session.  She was started on IV
insulin without a bolus in the ED and continued on an insulin
drip at 5U /hr with Q1hr finger sticks.  Her anion gap drifted
down to 13 and blood sugar to 96.  She was also treated with D5
1/2 NS with 20meq K, with frequent electrolyte checks for
hyperkalemia given her end stage renal disease.  She was
transitioned to subcutaneous insulin on hospital day 2.  She was
followed by [**Last Name (un) **] and discharged on Lantus 12 units at bedtime
and a Humalog ISS.
.
#. UTI: The patient had a benign UA but had >100,000 colonies of
enterococcus growing in her urine on a urine culture which was
finalized after the patient was discharged.  This is the likely
cause of her DKA and the patient was called as an outpatient and
treated with Augmentin 500mg daily after HD sessions.
.
# Altered mental status:  The patient received benzodiazepines
and narcotics in the ED and was noted to be ""sleepy"" during
numerous line attempts, but was apparently awake and oriented at
triage.  There was concern for cerebral edema in the setting of
over-correction of serum osms, but a CT head was negative.
.
# Abdominal pain: The patient carries the diagnosis of
gastroporesis, which may be etiology of her pain as she did
present with nausea and vomitting.  She responded to dilaudid,
ativan, and compazine in the ED.  Her lipase was normal and alk
phos was elevated, but other LFTs were normal.  Her exam was
benign.
.
# ESRD on HD:  She had missed several consecutive HD sessions
prior to admission.  She has a fistula for access and still has
good residual UOP. She was continued on sensipar and HD was
reinitiated as an inpatient.
.
#. Hypertension.  Her home regimen of clonidine, lisinopril, and
labetalol was continued.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD who
presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting found to be
hyperkalemic
.
# Hyperkalemia: She was found to be hyperkalemic with EKG showig
peaked T-waves after missing at least two sessions of
hemodialysis. She was given insulin, D50, calcium gluconate and
hemodialysis was pursued. The renal team was consulted. Her
lisinopril was initially held.  Her hemodialysis was completed
uneventfully.
.
# ESRD on HD: She underwent emergent hemodialysis following
placement of the temporary catheter in the emergency department.
The renal team was consulted.  She was continued on sevelemer. A
social work consult was placed given history of missed
hemodialysis sessions.
.
# Somnolence: Likely due to administration of morphine and
droperidol in setting of ESRD as was reportedly mentating at
baseline initially on ED arrival. Her mental status quickly
improved and sedating medications were avoided.
.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: AG = 16. [**Month (only) 116**] have degree of
uremia. With abd pain, concern for lactic acidosis although pt
unlikely to have ischemic bowel, especially given benign exam.
Glucose level not c/w DKA.  Her lactates and electrolytes were
monitored.  Her anion gap resolved without intervention.
.
# RUQ pain/N/V: Per ED history, symptoms typical of
gastroparesis. Has had similar pain in past with DKA
presentation but labs not consistent with this today. Alk phos
elevated but other LFTs nl, c/w prior labs. Lipase nl. Pt
currently without TTP on exam s/p morphine although somnolent.
N/V could occur in setting of uremia although BUN only 41.

Her abdominal exam remained benign throughout the admission.

# Hypertension: Initially very high on presentation, likely due
to pain.  Improved with pain control.  Her anti-hypertensives
were initially held in the setting of GI bleed (see below), but
labetalol and clonidine were restarted at her home doses prior
to discharge.
Her lisinopril was initially held in the setting of acute renal
failure.
.
# Diabetes Type I: Her fingersticks were initially low in the
setting of receiving insulin for hyperkalemia. She was given one
amp of D50 with improvement in blood sugars. She was restarted
onher home insulin regimen of 12 lantus Qhs and insulin sliding
scale.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: She was recently found to have a RLL
subsegmental PE on [**2101-4-25**]. Her INR was initially therapeutic.
She was continued on coumadin 4mg q 4pm until her episode of
maroon stool described below.  At that time, risks and benefits
of anticoagulation were weighed, and her coumadin was held.  Her
anticoagulation was not able to be restarted prior to the
patient leaving the hospital against medical advice.

# Marked Hematocrit Drop:  Patient was noted to have hematocrit
drop from 30 to 17.  The patient had oozing from right femoral
line site after its discontinuation for 1-2 days, as well as her
usual menses.  She was also noted to have maroon stool.  She was
transferred to the ICU where she received 2 units of FFP and 2
units of pRBCs.  Her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 25 and
then continued to rise towards 28.  No further episodes of
bleeding were noted, and her hematocrit remained stable.

GI was consulted and stated they would likely perform a
colonoscopy after the patient has been stabilized and returned
to the regular medical floor.  Unfortunately, the patient left
the hospital against medical advice prior to her tranfer to the
floor.

On the evening of discharge, the patient became very tearful and
upset regarding her length of hospitalization.  She expressed
her wishes to the leave the hospital against medical advice.

A long discussion was had with the patient by the intern,
resident, and attending physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 35230**].  The risks of
leaving the hospital, including infection, continued bleeding,
and death were discussed with the patient.  She verbalized
understanding of these risks after which she signed a discharge
against medical advice form.

Her PICC line was removed and the patient left the hospital.  An
email was sent to her PCP informing her of these events.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year old woman with hx of mixed cardiomyopathy
with EF 20-25% s/p AICD placement, CAD s/p PCI to RCA, diabetes,
hypertension and afib on warfarin. She presented from nursing
home s/p fall out of bed after which she hit her head. She
reportedly vomited shortly thereafter. Nursing home staff put
her back into bed, and she was later noted to be unresponsive.
Nursing home staff felt she had no pulses and initiated chest
compressions; however, when EMS arrived, patient was noted to
have pulses. EMS intubated patient at the scene and sent her to
outside hospital, where she had Head CT negative for bleed. She
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
.
[**8-26**]-admitted for N/V and RLQ pain at OSH, found to have E.coli
sepsis [**3-17**] UTI, treated with Augmentin and d/c'ed amiodarone
during that admission. Of note, CT head w/o contrast was neg.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were as follows: 60 109/65 17 100%
vent: TV 500, rate 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%. Exam notable for being
combative, roving horizontal eye movements but not following
commands(on sedation). Labs notable for Hct 35.6, WBC 14,
troponin of 0.16, creatinine of 0.16 and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 31100**]. Blood gas
as follows: 7.52/41/391/35 on CMV(FiO2 100%, Vt 450cc, RR 14,
PEEP 5). EKG was significant for prolong QT.
.
She was noted to be hypotensive to 70 in the ED with wide
complex polymorphic tachycardia at 200 beats/min which
subsequently degenerated into ventricular fibrillation
terminated by ICD shock x 2. She again went into wide complex
tachycardia with no pulse requiring one round of CPR. She
underwent another similar episode requiring CPR and external
shock at 200 [**Doctor First Name **] with ROSC. She was started initially given
amiodarone bolus but was switched to lidocaine bolus + gtt with
concern for torsades from prolong QT vs ischemic polymorphic
wide complex tachycardia. She was given 2 grams of magnesium, 40
meq of potassium and transferred to CCU. Cardiac arrest/Cooling
team was not called per ED team as her cardiac arrest were brief
at OSH and here.
.
On the floor, she is intubated.

Studies
Admission EKG [**2123-9-8**]: A-V sequential pacemaker. It is likely
the pacemaker is set with a long P-R interval. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2112-7-4**] the rhythm appears to be
atrio-ventricular paced on the current tracing.

TTE [**2123-9-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The coronary
sinus is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
akinesis of the septal and inferior walls and global hypokinesis
of the remaining walls. The basal inferolateral wall is
relatively preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters
are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe regional
and global biventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation. Small to moderate circumferential
pericardial effusion. Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior report (images unable to be reviewed) of
[**2112-7-4**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
The pericardial effusion is larger.
.
CT Head w/o Contrast [**2123-9-8**]: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction. Ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and in configuration.  The mastoid air
cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
.
CXR AP [**2123-9-8**]: An endotracheal tube ends at the level of the
clavicular heads, 5.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube
ends with the tip just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
This tube could be advanced by 5-10 cm. Note is made of a
dual-lead pacer/AICD device. A left neck IV catheter is noted,
with the tip not positioned within any identifiable large
vessel. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and note is made of
a dense left lower lobe opacity. Note is also made of mild
pulmonary
vascular congestion.
.
CXR AP [**2123-9-15**]: Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in the
standard position in the right atrium and right ventricle.
Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There is no evident pneumothorax.
Right PICC remains in place. Small right pleural effusion has
increased. Small left pleural effusion and bibasilar
atelectasis, left greater than right, have increased on the
right. Pulmonary edema has improved.
.
Echo [**2123-9-24**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed
jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2123-9-8**], the mitral regurgitation is reduced. The left
ventricular ejection fraction is similar.

.
#MONOMORPHIC VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION ARREST
The cause of VT is likely secondary to a degrading rhythm
centered around a scar from her previous RCA myocardial
infarction in [**2112**] versus toxicity with digoxin as level
returned at 2.  Other possibilities include inherited prolonged
QT.  Cardiac troponins peaked at .21.
      Patient was initially on levofed and a lidocaine drip.
Both these medications were discontinued after the first day
without incident and patient was briefly treated with
amiodarone.  Patient did endorse some chest pain during
admission, but this was centered around her ribs and is likely
due to compressions.  The pain resolved with lidocaine patches
and occasional vicodin.
      With regards to the AICD, the device was reprogrammed with
pAVI 120msec, [**Last Name (un) **] 100msec, HR=80 to improve the patient's
diastolic heart failure.  Additionally, the reprogrammed VT
therapy to VT detection ON at 150bpm with ATP x3 followed by 3
shocks at 25J, 36J, 36J. She was successfully transferred to the
floor on hospital day 6.
      Given the patient's severe MR, and low EF was likely
exacerbated by the dyssynchronous rhythm, therefore it was
determined the patient would likely benefit from placement of an
epicardial lead versus another attempt at placement via a
coronary sinus approach (prior attempt resulted in unroofing of
left coronary sinus). EP felt that the patient was a candidate
for endovascular placement of a left ventricular lead.
Therefore she had a biventricular
pacemaker upgrade on [**2123-9-23**] and tolerated the procedure well.
Repeat echocardiogram showed similar ejection fraction and
improvement in her mitral regurgitation.
.
#Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure
Patient with history of cardiomyopathy with EF of 15-20% from
[**2123-9-8**].  Patient was edematous upon admission and started on a
Lasix drip at 10mg/hr.  She was diuresed initially with lasix
then with torsemide and metolazone with improvement in her
respiratory status and edema. However diuretics were
discontinued due to rising creatinine. With improvement in her
renal function she was discharged on home torsemide.   Patient's
oxygen requirement was at her baseline at the time of discharge.

.
#UROSEPSIS
Patient was recently admitted for E.coli sepsis at an outside
hospital and discharged on oral amoxicillin. When patient
represented to this hospital, she was hypotensive, likely due to
decreased volume, but there was concern for ongoing sepsis.
Patient was initially treated with vanc/ zosyn/ flagyl and
initially narrowed to cefepime, with final dose given [**2123-9-12**]
for a total of 2 weeks antibiotic therapy following diagnosis of
the urosepsis.
     Blood cultures from admission showed no growth and WBC
ranged from 6.5 to 14 and patient was afebrile throughout
admission. ID was consulted who felt there were no signs or
symptoms concerning for infection.
.
# Elevated creatinine:
Over the course of admission patients creatinine trended upward.
 This was felt to be due to a combination of diuresis in
addition due to her poor ejection fraction.  This is expected to
improve now that she had undergone BiV upgrade.  At the time of
discharge her creatinine was trending down.
.
# Hx atrial fibrillation: Patients home coumadin was held for
her lead placement.  This was restarted prior to discharge. At
the time of discharge her INR was 1.3. Her home coreg was
changed to metoprolol due to hypotension. Additionally she was
restarted on PO amiodarone.
.
# Depression-  The patient was noted to have low mood throughout
her hospital stay.  She was seen by social work who offered her
support in terms of dealing with her illness.  Additionally her
home celexa was increased from 20 to 30 mg.
.
#CONDYLOMA ACCUMINATTA
Bilateral and extending 6 inches along perianal region.
Monitored throughout admission with consideration of involving
dermatology/ surgery in the future.
.
# Hypertension: Pt was hypotensive during hospitalization so
antihypertensives were initially held.  At the time of discharge
her home anti-hypertensives were restarted with the exception of
coreg which was changed to metoprolol.
#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization
- Patient will have follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiology on
[**10-1**].
- Transfer management of coumadin to the rehab facility

Discharge Diagnosis:
Ventricular tachycardia arrest
Acute on Chronic systolic congestive heart failure
Atrial fibrillation on warfarin
Diabetes Mellitus Type 2


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.


Discharge Instructions:
You fell out of bed and hit your head. You were found to be in a
dangerous rhythm called ventricular tachycardia and needed to be
shocked out of this rhythm. You were brought to [**Hospital **]
Hospital, then to [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted to the CCU and needed
to be on a breathing machine and your body temperature cooled.
You also had an acute exacerbation of your congestive heart
failure and needed lasix intravenously to take off the extra
fluid. Your ICD settings were adjusted. As your heart function
is so weak, it will be helpful to change your pacemaker function
to a biventricular mode. This will require the addition of
another pacemaker lead and we hope to do this on Thursday [**9-23**].
You will need to weigh yourself every day and call [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31102**] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or
5 pounds in 3 days. Your weight as discharge is 144 pounds.
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. WE changed your carvedilol to metoprolol succinate to lower
your heart rate
2. We changed your furosemide to torsemide to better prevent
fluid overload.
3. Discontinue digoxin
4. Increase celexa to 30 mg to better treat your depression
5. Start amiodarone again to treat your ventricular tachycardia
6. Start cephalexin for 6 days to prevent an infection at your
ICD site.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Decreased vision in left eye

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 35 year-old male with a history of hypertension
(not currently on medication) who presents with blurry vision in
his left eye. The patient was in his usual state of good health
until 2 weeks prior to admission, when his left eye developed
darkness in the center of the visual field and blurriness in the
peripheral visual field. Over the following two weeks, the
patient reports no improvement or worsening of the blurriness.
On the day of admission, the patient visited his PCP for
evaluation of vision, and blood pressure was found to be
264/160. The patient was given lasix (20 mg, PO) and Aspirin
(325 mg, PO) and sent by ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient denies
dizziness, headache, changes in speech, motor deficits, tingling
or numbness, back pain, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of
breath, recent drug use, or consumption of wine/aged cheese. The
patient reports an increase in his dietary salt intake during
the 2-3 weeks prior to admission.
.
In the ED, the patient was in NAD, with T 98.4 P 100 BP 235/154
RR 18 SaO2 100 (RA). He was found to have optic disc swelling
and macular edema in his left eye. He denied CP, SOB, N/V/D. His
neuro exam was reported as normal. An EKG showed ST depression
in II,III, avf, with non-elevated cardiac enzymes. BUN/Cr
returned as 22/1.7 (baseline 1.1 from 3/[**2126**]). A CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no volume overload. CT head showed no acute
hemorrhage. He received a total of 5 L fluid in the ED. He was
started on a nitroprusside drip, and was changed to labetalol.
BP improved to 199/125 and vision improved (not back to normal),
and the patient was transferred to the ICU for further
evaluation and treatment.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he was in NAD. T 94.4 P 95 BP 192/109
RR 20 SaO2 100 (RA). BUN/Cr was 16/1.3. The patient was
continued on labetolol drip, and was transferred to the floor
once confirmed as stable.
.

mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with

stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 35 year-old male with history of hypertension, who
presents to the ED with left eye blurriness, BP 264/160, and
clinical picture consistent with Hypertensive Emergency. The
patient reports an increased salt intake during the days
preceeding onset of visual blurriness.
.
# Hypertensive Emergency: Symptoms of headache and vision
changes resolved on the medical floor. No evidence of
intracranial bleed of cardiac ischemia as a result of
hypertensive episode. Patient does have elevated creatinine
likely the result of elevated blood pressures. Blood pressure is
now better controlled. Presume poorly controlled primary HTN as
etiology but considered secondary causes given profound HTN in a
young man. Renal artery stenosis was ruled out by ultrasound and
MRI. No evidence of rib notching on CXR to suggest coarctation.
Urine and serum tox screens are negative making
intoxication/sympathomimetics a less likely cause of patient's
extreme blood pressures. Obstructive sleep apnea unlikely. TSH
is wnl (hyperthyroid is unlikely).  Patient was started on
amlodipine 10mg, HCTZ 25mg, and lisinopril 10mg daily.  Blood
pressure responded and fell to < 150/90 at the time of
discharge. Nutrition and social work were consulted to discuss
life style changes and the challenges of starting new medical
regimens.  Patient may benefit from follow up with a dietician
and social worker. [**Name (NI) **] is instructed to follow up with his
primary care provider within three days of discharge to have his
blood pressure monitored and his regimen tailored.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine of presentation 1.7 (baseline
1.1 from 3/[**2126**]). Most likely primary hypertension leading to
renal failure rather than the reverse. ACEI were initially held
until creatinine was trending down.  Creatinine fell to 1.3 with
IVF. However, Patient experienced increased creatinine (2.0)
after simultaneously starting HCTZ and lisinopril.  Doses were
adjusted and creatinine was trending down at the time of
discharge.  Patient is instructed to follow up with his primary
care provider within three days of discharge to have his renal
function monitored on his new antihypertensive regimen.  Patient
schedule for an appointment with renal in outpatient setting to
establish care for likely underlying chronic renal
insufficiency.
.
# Blurry Vision: Seen by Opthomology in Emergency Department.
Described as hypertensive fundus changes - severe with optic
nerve swelling and macular edema. Recommended BP control and to
call if vision worsens. Presumed manifestation of hypertensive
emergency.  Patient vision returned to baseline at time of
discharge.  Patient is schedule follow up with outpatient
ophthalmology.
.
# Anemia: Likely dilutional as Hct fell from 43 on admission to
33 overnight with the administration of 5 L IVF. No apparent
bleeding. Patient asymptomatic.  Hct trended up after initial
IVF bolus to 39.7 at the time of discharge.
.
# EKG changes: ST depression in leads II, III, AVF. Likely
cardiac strain in setting of hypertension. Non-elevated
troponin. Normal CK-MB. No chest pain.

CT head [**2120-12-7**]:
FINDINGS:  There is a focal linear region of hyperattenuation
measuring 8 mm
in greatest dimension within the periventricular white matter
and involving
the lateral margin of the right internal capsule consistent with
acute
hemorrhage.  There is a smaller adjacent focus.  No significant
mass effect is
present.  The major intracranial cisterns are preserved.  There
is no
hydrocephalus.

No acute fracture is detected.  The paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells
are clear except for mild mucosal thickening in the left
maxillary sinus.

IMPRESSION:

Two linear foci of hyperattenuation within the right corona
radiata
consistent with an acute parenchymal hemorrhage.  No significant
mass effect
or midline shift is demonstrated.

MRI/MRA head [**2120-12-7**]:
Comparison is made with CT head on the same day and from MRI,
MRA performed
[**2121-4-22**] and [**2120-8-16**].

There is mucosal thickening and mucous retention cyst in the
left maxillary
sinus.

Acute hemorrhages are again noted in the right corona radiata,
unchanged from
the previous CT.  There is no significant surrounding edema, or
mass effect.
There is no associated diffusion restriction.  There is no
enhancement to
suggest an underlying lesion.  There is lack of flow related
enhancement in
the left petrous and cavernous ICA and in the right supraclinoid
ICA.  This is
unchanged from the prior report.  There are multiple scattered
subcortical and
periventricular hyperintensities which likely represent small
vessel ischemic
sequela in this patient with diabetes.

IMPRESSION:

Small foci of hemorrhage in the right corona radiata with
minimal surrounding
edema and no midline shift.

Probable small vessel ischemic sequela related to underlying
diabetes in the
subcortical and periventricular white matter.

Lack of normal flow voids in the left petrous, cavernous and
supraclinoid ICA
and the right supraclinoid ICA, reportedly unchanged from prior
examination.

Images from the previous MRI from [**2120-8-16**] are pending at this
time.

ECG [**2120-12-7**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave progression, probably a normal
variant.
Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2121-6-23**] there is no significant diagnostic change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Given the patient's severe hypertension in the setting of
hemorrhage, the patient was admitted to ICU for BP control.  Her
blood pressure was quickly controlled in the unit, and she was
called out to the floor for further management and observation.
MRI of the head showed a stable bleed, with no underlying mass
or vascular anomaly as the source for the right corona radiata
bleed.  It also revealed stable (previously known) 100% left ICA
occlusion and an occlusion in the right supraclinoid ICA.  Risk
stratification showed an A1C of 10.3 and a fasting lipid profile
with LDL 77 and HDL 65 while on lipitor 80 mg/d and zetia 10 mg
qod.

She was transferred out of the ICU to the floor on [**12-8**] and
observed for 24 hours.  Overall, her exam had improved: she was
found to have left arm 5-/5 UMN pattern weakness (deltoid and
triceps, full distally) with pronator drift, and full strength
in the left leg, though still with a wide-based, slightly
cautious gait, favoring the right side.  She was evaluated by PT
and OT and felt to be safe to go home with outpatient PT/OT.
She was restarted on her home dose of aspirin in addition to the
[**Month/Day (4) 4532**], considering her prior history, and the intracranial
hemorrhage was ultimately felt to be related to elevated ICP
with coughing, coupled with hypertension.

Cardiac Cath [**2186-10-27**] 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed 3 vessel and left main disease
unsuitable for PCI. The LMCA had an 80% stenosis distally at the
bifurcation of the LAD and LCX. The LAD had mild disease in the
previously placed proximal stent and moderate mid-segment
disease. The LCX had an 80% ostial stenosis with an 80% stenosis
proximally in a high OM1. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the
mid-segment and an 80% stenosis in the proximal right
posterolateral branch. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
severely elevated systemic arterial pressure despite a
nitroglyercine IV drip with an SBP of 181 mm Hg. The LVEDP was
also elevated at 25 mm Hg suggestive of severe diastolic
dysfunction. There was no gradient suggestive of aortic stenosis
with pullback across the aortic valve. 3. Left ventriculography
given renal insufficiency.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

ECHO [**2186-10-27**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Prominent symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Dilated thoracic aorta.
These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2179-6-22**], prominent left ventricular hypertrophy is now
identified.

[**2186-10-30**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST BYPASS:
Left and right ventricular function is preserved. The aorta is
intact. The study is unchanged.

[**2186-10-30**] Carotid Ultrasound
Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 29794**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   55 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

Final Report
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL
REASON FOR EXAM: Status post CABG, follow up effusion.
Since [**2186-11-1**], all tubes and catheters were removed
except right
internal jugular catheter ending into the cavoatrial junction.

Minimal bilateral pleural effusions are associated with small
left basilar
atelectasis. There is no volume overload. Lungs are otherwise
clear. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-10-27**] for
management of his dyspnea and chest pain. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which revealed severe left main
and three vessel coronary artery disease. Heparin, beta
blockade, a statin and aspirin were started. He ruled in for a
myocardial infarction by enzymes. Given the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no
significant internal carotid artery disease. On [**2186-10-30**], Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see
operative note for details. In summary he had a CABG x4 with
LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM,SVG-Diag,SVG-PDA. His bypass time was 113
minutes with a crossclamp of 90 minutes. He tolerated the
operation well and was transferred to the intensive care unit
for monitoring in stable condition. He did well in the immediate
postoperative period, however he did have a metabolic acidosis
and therefore remained intubated until the morning of POD1 at
6AM. He continued to do well and was transferred from the ICU to
the stepdown unit on POD2. The remainder of his post-operative
course was uneventful. Once on the floor his chest tubes and
epicardial wires were removed. His activity progressed and on
POD 4 he was discharged home with visiting nurses.

presents with vomiting and altered mental status. Her husband
reports that their two sons have been sick this week with a
viral gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea). The patient has
not been feeling very well for the last couple of days. When he
left for work this morning, she was ""ok."" But he called to check
in on her and found that she had been vomiting. He came home and
brought her to the ED. He reports that she has been speaking
without making sense and he can't understand what she is saying.
He reports that she ""gets like this"" when her sugars are very
high or if she has high temperatures. She has been hospitalized
several times for hypotension, infections in her toes or hypo or
hyperglycemia. He denies that she had fevers at home. She did
not complain of CP, SOB, f/c, abdominal pain, headache or change
in vision at home.
.
In the ED, her BP in initially was 212/137, HR 110, O2sat 99%
and T 96.8. Her BS was 436 on arrival. She vomited coffee ground
emesis and received zofram, regular insulin 10 units,
hydralazine 10mg IV, protonix 40mg IV. NG lavage was attempted
several times without success. GI was notified and decided to
hold on scoping her until she was more stable unless her HCT
dropped. Her BS decreased to 318 with a AG of 16. She was given
more insulin and IVF. Her temperature spiked to 104 axillary.
BCx and UCx and LP were performed. She was also given levo,
flagyl, ceftriaxone. She was admitted to the MICU for futher
care.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F with DM1, ESRD not on HD with hyperglycemia, n/v and
altered mental status in the setting of fevers to 104. She
initially was brought to the MICU for care for hypertenisve
urgency.
.
# altered mental status: The initially ddx included infection,
toxic metabolic, ingestion, hypertensive encephalopathy.  Her
CSF was clear and her cultures (blood, urine and CSF) were all
negative. Her toxic metabolic work up was negative including
RPR, TSH, B12, folate.  Her mental status cleared the next day
after controlling her blood pressure, so the likely diagnosis
was hypertensive encephalopathy. Her mental status throughout
the rest of her hospitalization was oriented times three and at
baseline.
.
# Fever/N/V/D: She had very high fevers on the first day of
admission up to 104 and was placed on a cooling blanket. She was
initially placed on vanco/zosyn for 48hrs until her cultures
were negative. The antibiotics were discontinued. She likely had
a viral illness similar to her family members.  Once transferred
to the medical floor she remained afebrile, tolerated a po diet
well.
.
# UGI bleeding: She had coffee ground emesis in ED and once in
the MICU on arrival. NG lavage could not be done (attempted
several times). Likely etiology was [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Last Name (un) 28726**] tear from
vomiting. GI was aware and given her other conditions, she was
not initially scoped. Her HCT remained stable and she was
continued on a PPI.  She should f/u with GI as an outpatient.
.
# hypertensive urgency: She was initially treated with a
labetolol gtt to control her blood pressures which were intially
over 200/100.  She was then tappered off and onto her home
medications of metoprolol and amlodipine. Her furosemide was
held given her rising Cr.  She will be discharged with
instructions of not to use her lasix until instructed by her
PCP.
.
# DM1: elevated BS in ED. Started on insulin gtt for concern for
mild DKA in setting of N/V/D. Mild ketoacids on labs. She was
transitioned to lantus and humalog with the help of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
diabetes consult. Her glargine was increased to 35, as was her
home sliding scale.  She will be discharged with glargin 35 and
her regular home sliding scale/
.
# ESRD: Patient's renal attending, Dr, [**Name (NI) **] saw patient rather
than renal consult and asked for renal c/s given slightly elev
Cr and potential need for HD soon. No acute need for HD (lytes
stable, euvolemic).  Her urine output was satisfactory on being
transferred to the floor.
.
# HTN: Patient off Labetolol gtt, and currently has been started
on Norvasc, Metoprolol and lasix.  Pt will be discharged on
Metoprolol and Norvasc at higher doses than her previous home
doses.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Doctor Last Name 28727**] is a 50F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, HTN, DM
type II who presented to the ED with 12-16 hrs of nausea and
vomiting.  Initially her emesis was reportedly clear, and then
became ""like coffee grounds"".  Per the patient her fingerstick
prior to coming to the ED was 400.  Of note the patient
freqently vomits black material at home.
Review of systems is otherwise negative for fevers, chills,
night sweats, HA, confusion, changes in vision, cough, diarrhea,
or dysuria.
In the emergency department her initially vital signs were 98.5,
229/119, 104, 14, 100%RA.  The patient was initially thought to
have complications of gastroparesis.  Hematocrit was stable at
38-40.  She was given her home blood pressure regimen,
anti-emetics, and 10 units of SC insulin for a blood sugar of
339.  Her fingerstick was checked one hour later, and noted to
be 482, with an anion gap of 13.  She was given 10 units of IV
insulin and started on an insulin gtt at 8units/hr.  She has
recieved a total of 1.5L, as she has ESRD.

  Radiology
=============

PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST: Mild cardiomegaly persists, unchanged.
Mediastinal
and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no focal lung
parenchymal
consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. There is no
pneumomediastinum. The surrounding osseous structures are
grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT HEAD
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or large area of
acute
infarction. However, MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] is more sensitive in the detection
of acute
infarction and can be considered if there is continued concern.

Upper Extremity U/S
IMPRESSION:

No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
=============
  EEG
=============

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow background and
occasional
bursts of generalized slowing. These findings indicate a
widespread
encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
most
common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing,
and
there were no clearly epileptiform features.

=============
  TTE
=============

 The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Trace aortic regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

=============
  ECG
=============

Sinus rhythm. Borderlne left axis deviation. Possible left
ventricular
hypertrophy. Leftward transition point, probably secondary to
left ventricular
hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-9-3**]
multiple
abnormalities as noted persist without major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Ms. [**Doctor Last Name 28727**] is a 50F with PMH s/f IDDM c/b ESRD on HD
and gastroparesis. Presented to the ED with hematemesis,
hyperglycemia, with cultures drawn yesterday growing GPC's.
.
#. Hematemesis: The patient reported. chronic hematemesis at
home, with ""coffee grounds"", approximately 10 times and up to a
cup full. The patient was typed and screened and followed with
serial HCts that improved and no transfusion was needed. The
patient was placed on an IV PPI and an Octreotide drip while she
awaited an EGD. GI perfomed the EGD and found gastritis, but no
active bleeding ulcers or evidence of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 329**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear. GI
also mentioned that she will need a colonoscopy in [**10-18**] to f/u
polyp and poor prep onprior colonoscopy. The patient was
transferred to the floor and her Hct remained stable until d/c
home.
.
#. Gram positive Bacteremia: Although patient without fevers or
chills, rapid growth on blood cultures in setting of hemodialsys
was concerning. Given the patient's prior hx of MRSA, Vancomycin
and Zosyn were started empirically. Zosyn was stopped prior to
transfer from the MICU to the floor. On the floor, after a day
of normal vital signs and reassuring CBCs, Vancomycin was
stopped. Given the presence of a heart murmur on physical exam
there was some concern for endocarditis, but a TTE did not
reveal any concerning vegetations. In the end, the blood cxs
great coagulase negative staph and it was felt by the medicine
team that this was likely a contaminant.

#. Hyperglycemia/DM: The patient was continued on Lantus and
ISS. It was thought that her blood sugars may have been elevated
in the setting of infection. There were no acute diabetic
related issues during this hospitalization.
.
#. Hypertensive Urgency: Improved, Holding antihypertensives for
now, would start metoprolol and amlodipine after patient begins
taking PO's. Due to recent AMS from suddent BP drop but active
GIB, would aim for goal SBP near 160-180 (30-40% decreased in
first 24hrs) as a balance, unless actively symptomatic. The
patient was restared on her antihypertensive medications on the
medicine floor and she tolerated them well. She was frequently
walked by nursing with no abnormal orthostatic vital signs.

.
#. Dysarthria / Altered mental status: It was thought that
patient's altered mental status was due to over agressive BP
lowering in the ED. Head CT was negative. Neurology was
consulted and agree with this assessment, but prefered to do an
EEG to r/o seizure. in setting of agressive BP lowering. At the
time of d/c the final read on the EEG was pending, but neurology
claimed they would be responsible to follow up with the
patient's primary care doctor if any abnormalities were revealed
that needed further workup.
.
#. Gastroparesis: The patient's home metoclopramide was held in
the ICU and restarted on the medicine floor when she was
tolerating po meals. There were no acute gastroperesis related
issues during this hospitalization.
.
#. ESRD on HD: The patient received her regularly scheduled HD.
There were no acute renal issues during this hospitalization.
.
#. Elevated cardiac enzymes: Likely demand ischemia in setting
of hypertensive urgency / emergency during last admission.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: Holding home pravachol while taking PO's.
Statin was restarted on the medicine floor when the patient was
tolerating po memals.
.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital for hyperglycmeia and vomiting. In the
ER your blood pressure was very elevated. After getting some
medication to lower your blood pressure, you were confused and
there was some concern for stroke. Your Head CT was negative. It
was thought that you most likely experienced your symptoms
secondary to a drop in blood pressure. Neurology performed an
EEG as well to rule out any seizure activity. They will follow
up with your primary care doctor regarding the results of this
test.

There was one specimen of your blood that grew bacteria, but it
was thought that this was likely a contaminant. All of your
other lab work indicated that you did not have a blood
infection.

You came in with some bleeding from the upper GI tract, but this
seems to have resovled. Your blood counts were stable and you
did not vomit on the floor. You were started on Pantoprazole, a
proton pump inhibitor to decrease the acid secretion in your
stomach and reduce your risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding from
the stomach.

Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any
light headedness, loss of concioussness, chest pain, dizziness,
fevers, chills, vomitting, dark or red stools, belly pain or any
change in your condition.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6431**] early next week and be
sure to discuss with her your blood pressure medications. I have
scheduled an appointment with a Nurse Practitioner ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**])
that works with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14116**] to discuss your diabetes following
this hospital admission on  [**9-22**] at 11 am. You already have an
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14116**] scheduled for [**Month (only) 359**].  You also
have an appointment for an upper endoscopy at [**2145-9-20**] at 10:30
am to evalaute the reason for your stomach bleeding.

HD, and HTN who was just discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] today at 3pm and
returned at 9pm with hematemesis and HTN. Pt reports she had HD
today and then was discharged home. She felt unwell when she got
home and reports some vomiting of blood; small quantities. She
reports that her BP was ""high"" as well, but not sure if the
numher. She also says her sugar was i the 400s for which she
took 10U insulin and it came down to the 200s. She reports +N/V,
+ hematemesis, no adominal pain/diarrhea or BRBPR. She also
denies any headache, visual changes, numbness/weakness or
tingling. She reports being compliant with her medications and

adjusted. She was subsequently readmitted [**9-5**] with coffee
ground emesis, HTN and hyperglycemia. She received IV labetolol
in the ED which dropped her SBPs from 200s to 90s and
subsequently developed drowsyness, decreased responsiveness, and
aphasia. She was seen by neurology who felt that her sxs were to
global hypoperfusion in the setting of low BP, and she improved
with normalization of her BP. GI saw the patient and she
underwent an EGD which demonstrated gastritis. She was placedo
Protonix 40mg daily and discharged home [**9-9**]. Her HTN was tx
with her regular home medications w/o adjustment.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y.o. female with PMH significant for IDDM c/b ESRD on HD and
gastroparesis who presented to the ED with hematemesis and found
to have SBP 200s. The following issues were investigated during
this hospitalization:
.
#GI Bleed: Repeat EGD was deferred as it had been done just days
before and only showed gastritis without varices. Consideration
was given to bleeding from gastritis vs. [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear from
retching. Patient remained hemodynamically stable, not requiring
a transfusion and maintaining a stable Hct. PPI [**Hospital1 **] was
continued.
.
#Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: Pt initially presented with a blood
sugar in the 200s with an anion gap. Of note, she had not taken
her Lantus prior to arrival to the ED and reportedly has a
history of non-compliance. This was corrected with insulin and
IVF.
.
#Labile blood pressure: Pt with markedly elevated BP on
presentation to ED requiring nitro gtt. Of note, patient had a
recent episode of mental status change when her BP dropped to
SBP of 90 after receiving Labetalol IV for hypertension. She has
since been taking Fludricortisone PRN for orthostasis. Labile BP
has been attributed to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of
poorly-controlled DM. BP was moderately well-controlled during
the remaineder of this hospitalization with a goal SBP of
150-170s.
.
#Rash: Patient was noted to have a rash on discharge that
resembled shingles. It was not painful, though it was pruritic
and was unilateral on the left side of her mid-back, extending
forward onto the chest wall. Per the patient, it had been
present for over a week and thus Acyclovir was felt to not be
likely to be beneficial. Patient has no known [**Hospital1 28729**]
besides relative [**Name (NI) 28729**] with DM. She was discharged
with instructions to employ supportive care for her rash while
it lasted. Her PCP was notified of this development for
follow-up.
.
#ESRD: Patient was followed by renal and last HD was performed
on [**9-9**]. She was discharged on a Tu/Th/Sat schedule with her
next session being Tuesday, [**9-14**].
.
#Gastroparesis: Patient was maintained on outpatient
Metaclopramide.
.
#Hyperlipidemia: Patient was maintained on outpatient Pravachol.

Brief Hospital Course:
Below is a hospital course by systems. The patient went first to
the SICU and came out to the general floor for 48 hours prior to
d/c. The patient was taken off anticoagulation secondary to the
UGI bleed, but remained on GI prophylaxis and boots for DVT
prophylaxis throughout. The patients bleeding stopped and fluid
status and electrolytes were normalized through the hospital
course. Podiatry was consulted secondary to his chronic LE
diabetic ulcers. Urology was consulted for a difficult foley
placement secondary to penile swelling from the fluid
resuscitation. Chronic pain was consulted to maximize his PO
pain regimen.

NEURO: While in the ICU, the patient experienced delerium, which
promply resolved after minimizing sedation/anxiolytics,
reformatting his pain regimen to minimize narcotics, as well as
moving out to the floor. He is A/O x 4 upon d/c,

CV: Pt remained in a-fib with some runs of trigeminy and PVC's,
which has been a chronic and unchanged arrhythmia. His
anticoaglation was held secondary to the GI bleed and should be
restarted 1 month after d/c. He continues on lopressor and
amiodarone for rate control. The patients fluid status was
normalized as described below.

PULM: During ICU care, the pt. had minimal O2 requirements w/ 2
L NC, and is off O2 and sats of 100% on RA. CXR was NEG and no
other issues.

GI: The patient received endoscopy on the day of admission that
found esophagitis,
and 2 bleeding duodenal ulcers. Hemostasis was established with
epi injection and electrocautery. The patient was transitioned
from NPO to a regular heart healthy, diabetic diet throughout
the hospital stay.

HEME/ID: The pt. received a total of 11 U PRBCs b/w the
transferring hospital (10 U) and [**Hospital1 18**] (1U). He remained stable
w/ Hct of 26 after tx. Throughout the stay the pt. was afebrile
w/ WBCs highest at 12 and stable at 8 upon d/c.

GU/Renal: The patient was edematous and fluid overloaded upon
admission secondary to fluid and blood resuscitation. This was
subsequently diuressed over the hospital stay to a euvolemic
state. electrolytes were repleted appropriately. The pt.
experienced some incontinence secondary to bladder spasm, and
urology was c/s to place a foley because it was difficult with
the penile edema from the fluid resusc. His foley was d/c'd
today and a voiding trial is pending. Pt. is dtv b/w [**4-5**] and
will be at [**Hospital1 1501**], if no void foley must be replaced.

Ext: Podiatry has seen the patient for chronic ulcers on LE 2nd
DM. He had +Cx pseudomonas, and was started on [**Hospital1 **] acetic acid
dressing changes. He is not currently prescribed ABx per
podiatry, but the organism is resistant to quinalones, and if
the wound becomes purulent, another [**Doctor Last Name 360**] should be chosen to
Tx. No surgical intervention was necessary, and no osteomyelitis
was seen on XR. He should arrange close f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in
[**Location (un) 1110**]. he continues on his pain Rx for neuropathic pain. He
should receive PT/OT at the [**Hospital1 1501**].

Mr. [**Known lastname 4135**] is an 84 yo M with AF on warfarin, CAD s/p CAB, ESRD
on peritoneal dialysis, polyneuropathy, and other medical issues
transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for peritoneal dialysis and
recent intraventricular hemorrhage [**3-16**] fall.
.
Patient states frequent falls, every other week since back
surgery in [**2096**].  He reports a fall about 10 days ago and caused
posterior scalp laceration s/p stapling.  His INR was not
checked and he had not had Coumadin dose changed for the past
several months.  He states taking warfarin 4 mg daily except for
Friday when he takes 7 mg.  About 4 days prior to admission,
staples were removed, but has been oozing.  He noticed that his
pillow was stained with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he went to [**Hospital **] Hospital to
get suture where his INR was found to be 9.2 and 10 point Hct
drop compared to about 1 week prior.  Per report, he received
FFP and vitamin K there.  However, since [**Location (un) **] does not do PD
and his wife has not been able to help him with it due to recent

IMAGING:
[**1-13**] CT HEAD: FINDINGS: A small amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage layers posteriorly in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
lateral ventricle. No additional intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage is identified. Ventricular dilatation is unchanged
since [**2096**], with prominence of the sulci, likely due to atrophy.
Focal hypodensities in the right thalamus and left lentiform
nucleus are unchanged since [**2096**], and likely reflect lacunes.
Confluent periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypoattenuation is compatible with the sequela of chronic
microvascular infarction. A large posterior parietal subgaleal
hematoma is present. No fractures are seen. Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. Calcification of
the cavernous carotid arteries is present.
IMPRESSION: Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left lateral ventricle. Large posterior
parietal subgaleal hematoma.
.
[**1-14**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable cardiac
enlargement and calcification of the aorta consistent with
atherosclerosis. Relatively lower lung volumes with no focal
airspace consolidation appreciated. Crowding of the pulmonary
vasculature with possible minimal perihilar edema, but no overt
pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4135**] is an 84 year old male with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), atrial fibrillation (AFib)
on warfarin, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post bypass
surgery who presented with intraventricular bleed transferred to
MICU for neurological monitoring.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Intraventricular bleed was secondary to recent fall in the
setting of being on warfarin and with supratherapeutic INR.
Based on CT head without contrast.  [**Month (only) 116**] have some mild sensation
deficit in the LE L>R, could be chronic given underlying
diabetes.  Currently asymptomatic and stable from
intraventicular bleed.  He did recieve one unit packed RBCs
before transfer and his hematocrit was maintained above 25. His
warfarin was held and he was given vitamin K which brought his
INR to therapeutic levels quickly.  Neurosurgery was consulted
and they recommended that he be closely monitored.
He was discharged with instructions to continue antiepileptic,
dilantin x 10days and to follow up with neurosurgery clinic in
[**5-18**] weeks with repeat head imaging.  Given multiple falls, would
not recommend restarting anticoagulation.
.
# Anemia:  Likely chronic in nature with acute intraventricular
bleed as mentioned above.  Recieved one unit packed RBCs and
warfarin was held.
.
# Falls/Syncope:  Based on history, concerning for cardiogenic
arrhythmia given no prodrome with drop attacks in the setting of
underlying CAD requiring CABG.  Also could be due to gait
instability from peripheral neuropathy from T2DM.  Also, patient
had history of CVA and has carotid stenosis, although symptoms
unlikely from TIA.  Monitored on tele with no significant
arrhythmias.  PT saw patient and felt that he could safely be
discharged home with services.
.
# ESRD on PD:  Creatinine at 5.4.  No significant electrolyte
derangement at this time.  He did continue on PD while an
inpatient.  Continued renal cap and calcitriol.  He gets epo
20,000 unit every other week.  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
[**Hospital1 **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] as an outpatient
.
# Chronic AF: High risk for bleed given frequency of
falls/syncopes; however, with CHADS 5 is also at high risk of
stroke.   Given ICH, warfarin was stopped and coagulopathy was
aggressively reversed in the ED.  At time of discharge, INR was
1.0.  Decision whether to resume anticoagulation was deferred to
cardiologist but is strongly not recommended given frequent
falls. at this time.
.
# CAD s/p CABG/HTN/HLD (hypertension and hyperlipidemia):
Continued home Diovan, isosorbide, furosemide, amlodipine.
Would recommend switching simvastatin to atorvastatin 40 mg
given higher risk of rhabdo with simvastatin on amlodipine.
.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM):  On insulin, continued home
regimen.
.
# Anxiety: continued citalopram 20 mg as at home
.
TRANSITONAL ISSUES:
ICH: antiepileptic x 10 days, follow up with head imaging in
neurosurgery clinic in [**5-18**] weeks

afib: stopped coumadin given recent ICH, will need to discuss
possible initiation of antiplatelts

History of Present Illness:
44 yo woman with history of DM, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent
PNAs who was admitted on [**2120-10-22**] after presenting to the ED
with approximately 3 week history of worsening rash. The patient
reports that she developed itchy rash that started on her hands
in mid-[**Month (only) **]. She was initially treated by her allergist for
presumed contact dermatitis with [**Name (NI) 41079**], which made the
itching worse. She underwent patch testing as an outpatient with
no reaction to the allergens tested. For approximately 3-4 days
prior to admission, she started to develop ""red bumps"" on her
legs that then spread over her entire body. She has not been
using any emollients. She denies any new medications or
exposures except for a shampoo that she used for stop hair loss.

.
In the ED, she was given morphine, percocet, Benadryl and
Unasyn. The patient was admitted to medicine hospitalist service
and dermatology was consulted. They biopsied the rash on left
thigh. Biopsy results were consitent with a hypersensitivity
reaction. Dermatology recommended Prednisone taper starting at
60 mg x 3 weeks. The patient has a history of DKA while treated
with steroids. On the floor, her finger stick glucose was
difficult to control and the [**Last Name (un) **] team recommended starting

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2120-10-29**]):
      PROBABLE GARDNERELLA VAGINALIS.    10,000-100,000
ORGANISMS/ML..
.
Left Thigh Bx:
Perivascular and interstitial lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with
scattered eosinophils.  No atypical lymphocytes are seen. There
is minimal spongiosis. The findings are consistent with a dermal
hypersensitivity reaction. Additional levels show similar
findings to the original sections, namely, a focally acute
spongiotic dermatitis with dermal eosinophils; no scabies mites
seen.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
44 year old woman with history of type I DM,
hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent pneumonia admitted with
progressive rash most likely hypersensitivity reaction with
persistent hyperglycemia.
.
# Hyperglycemia:  The patient intially had good blood glucose
control but once PO steroids were started for rash, she had
significant hyperglycemia (500s). As she has a history of DKA
while on steroids in the past. Was transferred to the ICU for an
insulin drip and frequent blood sugar monitoring.  She was
slowly transitioned back to her insulin pump after her steroid
dose was lowered to the intermediate dose.  Her basal insulin
rate and the insulin:carbohydrate ratio for bolus dosing was
directed by the [**Last Name (un) **] consult service throughout the rest of
her admission.  She will follow up with the [**Last Name (un) **] physicians
within a week of discharge.
.
# Rash/Hypersensitivity reaction: The patient was evaluted by
dermatology and a skin biopsy was performed which was consistent
with hypersensitivity dermatitis.  She was started on a steroid
taper of prednisone 60 mg po qd x 1 wk; then 40 mg po qd x 1 wk;
then 20 mg po qd x 1 wk with topical steroids, emollients, and
antihistamines for symptomatic relief.  The erythema made
gradual improvement over the course of her hospital stay.  She
will follow-up with dermatology as an outpatient. Her sutures
from the biopsy site can be removed 2 weeks after the biospsy
procedure was done. Reaction was idiopathic, but may have been
due to new recent shampoo.
.
 # Leukocytosis. The elevated white blood cell count was thought
secondary to the steroids.  There were no localizing symptoms of
infection, the patient was afebrile, had no respiratory or
urinary symptoms and the urinalysis showed no evidence of
infection.
.
# Anemia. Hct at baseline (low 30's). Fe studies in [**2117**] c/w
anemia of chronic disease. She is on aranesp at home.  While in
the hospital, she received epogen 3x/week.  Also found to be
Fe-deficient, was started on Fe 325 daily.  Should f/u with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 805**] for continuation of Epogen/Aranesp.
.
#Acute on Chronic Renal Failure, Hyperkalemia:  during the
hospital course, the patient was noted to have intermittent
hyperkalemia without ECG changes.  Felt to be secondary to
myopathy, CRI, and possible low-grade acidosis from
hyperglycemia.  Renal team was consulted who recommended low-K
diet but did not think HD was necessary.
.
#Hypothyroidism:  NL TSH but low Free T4.  Given the patient had
complained of hair loss, she was started on low dose T4 (75
mcg).  She should have this followed as an outpatient.
.
#Gardenella Vaginalis infection: noted on UCx.  She will
complete a 7 day course of Metronidazole.
.
#?UTI:  pt had one UCx that grew CNS; this was felt to be a
contaminant as blood cultures had no growth. Repeat Ucx without
WBCs.
.
#Elevated CK:  CK checked b/c the patient was noted to have lg
blood but no RBCs on UA.  Thought to be d/t myopathy from
steroids, though patient does have a history of a myopathy from
statins.  Less likely from Zetia.  Needs to be followed as an
outpatient.

...................................
[**2177-7-8**] CXR: 1. Support lines and tubes in place as described
above.
2. Left lower chest opacity likely representing left pleural
effusion,with associated atelectasis; an underlying infectious
process cannot be ruled out.
.
[**2177-7-8**] Lumbo-Sacral X-ray: Six markedly suboptimal bedside (&
possibly intraoperative) radiographs of the lumbar spine with
lateral images apparently obtained with cross-table technique
lying supine. There is possible displaced fracture of L5
vertebral body. However, this appearance does not correlate with
the history provided & fracture or destruction of this body was
not seen on more satisfactory CT of this area done [**2177-6-9**].
Clinical correlation might be helpful.
.
[**2177-7-8**] R Foot X-ray: Minimal interval change with findings
suggestive of distal 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis. Probable
secondary reflex sympathetic osteodysrophy.
.
[**2177-7-8**] CT Head W/Out Contrast: 1. Enlarged ventricles which is
new when compared to [**2176-8-30**], although exact age is
indeterminate. This may represent underlying communicating
hydrocephalus, and an MRI with CSF flow study could be performed
for further evaluation, if warranted on clinical grounds. 2. No
evidence of mass or mass effect.
.
[**2177-7-9**] L Foot X-ray: No definite radiographic evidence for
osteomyelitis. Marked osteopenia along the medial distal fifth
metatarsal head again noted. No obvious fracture. Given the
degree of osteopenia, subtle abnormalities may not be
radiographically apparent. As such, bone scan or MRI may help
for further assessment.
.
[**2177-7-9**] MRI Head:  1. Small, area of diffusion abnormality in
the anterior right parietal lobe.This may be due to subacute
infarct. However, in absence of gadolinium enhancement, other
processes could not be excluded. Gadolinium enhance study can be
obtained if clinically indicated following consultation with
renal service. 2. No hydrocephalus. 3. Remote suboccipital
craniectomy with residual deformity of craniocervical
junction.

[**2177-7-11**] Swallowing Video:

FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and
esophagus without
evidence of obstruction. There was intermittent aspiration of
thin liquids.
For further details, please refer to speech and swallow division
note in OMR.
IMPRESSION:
Penetration and aspiration of thin liquids.


Brief Hospital Course:
56yo M with DM2, PVD, CHF, chronic osteomyelitis admitted to the
MICU for increased sputum, persistent osteomyelitis, fevers and
decreased mental status. Pt recently had a long hospitalization
course for osteomyeltitis complicated by multifactorial
respiratory failure s/p trach/peg, renal failure on HD now, new
diagnosis of CML now on gleevac, and persistent AMS of unclear
etiology.

#Fevers: Started on broad antibiotic coverage with linezolid ,
bactrim and meropenem to cover osteomyelitis of right foot,
stenotrophomonas pna (from prior sputum cultures as well as
repeat sputum culture from this admission), and UTI (rehab
center reports pus in urine). Patient's symptoms improved,
afebrile, more lucid, less secretions, and antibiotics were
switched to Daptomycin and Meropenem, per ID reccomendations.
Patient will be on dapto/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] for 6 weeks (start date [**2177-7-8**])
followed by PO antibiotics for osteomyelitis suppression.
Patient was transfered to the medical wards after stablilized.

#Osteomyelitis: Pt has osteomyelitis of right heel as well as
ulcers and infections of left foot and coccyx. Was initially on
linezolid and meropenem for coverage and then switched to
Daptomycin and Meropenem (start date: [**2177-7-8**]). ID followed pt
and reccomended 6 weeks of dapto/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] followed by daily PO
suppressive therapy. Pt found to have coccygeal ulcers and was
followed by wound care with daily dressing changes.
.
# CML: Pt was recently diagnosed with CML in [**2177-4-29**]. He was
given hydrea and gleevac on last admission. Gleevac was briefly
stopped at rehab and counts came back up. On this admission, pt
was re-started on gleevac 200mg daily along with allopurinol.
Hematology followed pt and [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs were performed
to carefuly monitor response. WBC still continued to be high in
the 80-120s with mildly elevated LDH (550-650) and elevated Uric
Acid (4-7.5 range). Pt will continue current gleevac regimen for
CML suppression until he decides to focus on comfort measures
only. This dose of gleevac (pill is crushed into liquid form) is
sufficient to make patient comfortable until he withdraws care.
When he focuses on immediate end of life care, he will likely
want to stop taking this medication.
.
# Altered Mental Status: On prior admission, pt had AMS thought
to be secondary to intracranial leukostasis from CML, although
symptoms did not improve with leukoparesis.  On this admission,
patient was initialy found to have AMS and had CT and MRI
workup. Infection was likely the source of his AMS since he
became significantly more lucid with antibiotics.

# Hydrocephalus: Unclear etiology but patient has h/o spinal
surgeries for meningioma in [**10-7**]. There was concern that pt had
obstruction of drainage from either septic or malignant mass
given complicated history of osteo and CML. However, MRI done on
[**2177-7-9**] showed no hydrocephalus. Mental status cleared and
symptoms of AMS were attributed to infection.
.
# Nutrition: Nutrition consulted and recommended nectar thick,
and sips of thins; as pt??????s primary goal is his comfort. Pt also
written for soft diet. He initially had a dopoff tube in place
for meds and tube feeds which was discontinued after long
discussion with patient about deciding to eat food despite
aspiration risks. Patient aware of his very poor prognosis and
elected to eat food that he desires, despite the risks. Pt's
preference of food was given in small bites while patient
sitting up.
.
# Pain: Pt had bony pain from leukocytosis assoc w/CML, ulcers,
as well as chronic pain from neuropathies, meningiomas,
osteomyelitis. Pt was given dilaudid every 2 hrs and gabapentin
for pain control. Palliative care was closely involved in pain
managment. Went home on 4-6mg PO dilaudid every 2 hrs for pain.
He was also written for IV dilaudid 0.75mg as needed for pain if
he can not take PO. He still had pain on this regimen but
preferred to be alert. This regimen will unlikely be sufficient
when patient decides to focus on end of life and comfort.
.
# Decreased hearing:  Left ear's with erythema and pt reported
some decreased hearing. He was given daily ciprodex.

# Respiratory: Pt was trached as of last admission. He was on
3.5L O2 and given neb treatments all through his trach. On
admission he was noted to have increased secretions which
decreased with antibiotics. Sputum culture grew
stenotrophomonas- sparse growth, and patient was briefly treated
with bactrim. Stenotrophomonas thought to be more likely
contaminate or colonization, given the sparse growth and
reccurent positive cultures.
.
# Oliguria/ESRD/anasarca: Pt originally came in with foley which
was d/c'ed for possible UTI. Pt's urethral meatus oozed some
dark [**Year (4 digits) **] and urology was consulted. New foley was placed to
drain old [**Year (4 digits) **] in bladder. Foley was flushed several times a
day and no clots were seen. Pt was found to be oliguric,
urinated 50-200cc/day. Received HD every T/T/S as well as
ultrafiltration 2 days a week to remove extra fluid for
anasarca. Renal closely followed patient throughout
hospitalization. All medications were renally dosed. Pt will
have HD at rehab center every T/Th/Sat. He does not need further
ultrafiltration at this point unless his clinical status
changes. He will get his Daptomycin (q 48 hrs) and Meropenem (q
24 hrs). On HD days, he will get these meds after HD. Of note,
patient phosphorus levels fluctuated. At times he required
neutrophos supplements for low phos.

# Coagulopathy: Pt found to have elevated INR and coumadin for
A. fib was held. DIC panel was negative. INR trended down.
.
# A. Fib: Pt was rate controlled with metorpolol. Coumadin was
held initially for an elevated INR and was then discontinued
because pt has poor prognosis and end stage disease and history
of GI bleeds on coumadin.
.
# Goals of Care: Pt was told if his poor prognosis. Case
management/social work/palliative care were all active in
helping patient and family coordinate care and goals. It was
decided that patient wanted to be transfered to [**Hospital **] Hospital
(In [**Location (un) **], ultimately) close to home so he could see his
mother and son and then become comfort measures only. He
requested to stop HD at that point and to have pain control for
comfort. He described that he felt that stopping HD would be the
most peaceful way to go. However, it is important to note that
pt said he would be willing to go back to the hospital, should
he become acutely sick again, if he has not yet seen his mom. It
is very important to him to stay alive to see his mom and son.
[**Name (NI) **] is still DNR/DNI and this was discussed at legnth. After he
sees his mother and son, he has made it clear that he would like
to focus on comfort measures.

While inpatient, he decided that he did not want tube feeds
anymore and was willing to take the risks so he can eat food
that he enjoys. He will be going home on whatever food he wishes
to eat. He is very aware of the risks of aspiration and
pneumonia. He eats food in small bites with one-to-one
assistance and sitting upright.

In terms of pain, he will be going to rehab on dilaudid 4-6mg
every 2 hrs for pain. At this point, he would like to keep this
pain regimen so he can be alert for his family. However, when he
decides to focus on comfort, he will likely need more
medication.

He will continue his gleevac, meropenem, daptomycin,
hemodialysis, wound care until he sees his mother and son. After
that, he would like to stop hemodialysis and focus on pain
control and comfort.

Discharge Instructions:
I was a pleasure providing care for you during your
hospitalization.

You were admitted for fevers and osteomyelitis (an infection of
the bones in your feet). You were given antibiotics through your
vein to treat the infection. You had daily dressing changes for
the wounds on your buttox and feet.

You were found to have a very high white [**Location (un) **] cell count,
likely from your leukemia (CML) and an infection. You were given
Gleevac for the leukemia and seen by leukemia doctors. You had
[**Location (un) **] checked often to make sure that your electrolytes were
repleted.

You had hemodialysis for your renal failure and for the water
that was in your legs.

You met with Palliative care to discuss end of life goals and
pain control. You requested to go to [**Hospital1 **] facility where you
could spend time with your family and ultimately focus on being
comfortable.

The following changes were made to your medications:
-Coumadin was stopped
-Gleevac 200mg daily was re-started
-Dilaudid 4-6mg PO every 2 hrs for pain was started

You will be on the antibiotics: Daptomycin (every 48 hrs) and
Meropenem (every 24 hrs) for a total 6 week course.

For now, you will continue the chemotherapy, the antibiotics,
until you see your family.

It was a priviledge to take care of you.


Followup Instructions:
You may contact the [**Hospital1 **] if you
have questions about your antibiotics regimen. You will continue
dapto/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] for total of 6 weeks (began [**2177-7-8**]), followed by
oral suppressive antibiotic therapy.

Chief Complaint:
Hypertension urgency, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Acute Diastolic CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
30 year old Female who presents to the ED with worst headache of
her life, found to be having malignant hypertension with a [**First Name3 (LF) **]
pressure approximately 210/110. She was also noted with severe
hyperglycemia 383, rose 445 on arrival to the floor. She is also
noted in diastolic CHF with a markedly elevated BNP. She was
hypoxemic as well at 88% on room air.
.
The patient notes she has felt terrible for over a week, with
vomitting on the day of arrival and may have skipped 1-2 doses
of her insulin sliding scale as a result. She denies fever or
chills. She reports that her hypertension has been very
difficult to manage, recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over at [**Last Name (un) **]
on [**7-8**], and her medications were adjusted. On morning of
admission her BP this AM was 211/110. She was driven to the ED
by her mother for her pounding frontal and left sided headache.
  Pt was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 36190**]/[**2150**] for viral meningitis but
reports resolution of her symptoms prior to this episode. She
notes a R hallux toenail fell off a few weeks ago but denies any
pain, redness or swelling. She she denies any other infectious
symptoms including fever, congestion, cough, SOB, dysuria, or
diarrhea.
  In the ED initial vital signs were 97.3 99 196/106 20 100%.
She was transiently triggered for hypoxia s/p receiving zofran
4mg, morphine 4mg, her sats was 88% on RA, which improved with
O2 to 98% on 2L. EKG showed nsr, no ST changes. Patient declined
LP, Ha resolved. Labs were notable Cr of 2.7 (baseline 1.3 in
[**3-/2150**]), proBNP: 8244, Hct: 28.3 (baseline), Trop-T: 0.07, Gluc
of 383, AGap=22. CT Head W/O Contrast negative for acute
intracranial process. CXR notable for fluid overload. Pt was
given zofran 8mg IV, reglan 10mg IV, Morphine Sulfate x1,
labetolol 20mg IV x2, hydral 10mg IV x 1, Lorazepam, Furosemide,
Aspirin 325mg, 10U SQ x1. Patient was admitted for HTN
urgency/emergency with hyperglycemia and transferred to the MICU
for insulin drip, HTN, and fluid management. Vital signs prior
to transfer 161/79 86 19 100%2L.
   In the ICU she was placed on insulin drip with normalization
of ion gap and was transitioned to her home glargine and ISS,
diabetic diet and D5 1/2NS+20K. She was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] this
morning who recommended q2-4h FSBG, home glargine 20U QAM and an
increased humalog sliding scale.
   Her [**Last Name (un) **] pressure was controlled on her home regimen with
goal BP in 140-150. Her lisinopril and furosemide were held in
the context of [**Last Name (un) **]. Her renal injury was treated with gentle
hydration and Cr remained stable. Her mild hypoxia in the ED
resolved in the MICU, patient was transferred to the floor on
room air. She was continued on all of her other home
medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
30F with poorly controlled TIDM c/b gastroparesis and
neuropathy, HTN, CKD, Diastolic CHF who presented to the ED
[**2150-8-3**] with headache and hypertensive urgency found to have
elevated FSBG to 300s, +AG, fluid overload, and [**Last Name (un) **] with unclear
precipitant, admitted to the MICU and stabilized on insulin drip
and antihypertensive, transferred to the floor on home [**Last Name (un) **]
and [**Last Name (un) **] pressure medications.
.
#. DKA/T1DM: Pt's CBGs ranged 400-500s for 1-2 days. Patient was
admitted with CBG of 383 and AG 17. She was admitted to the ICU
for initiation of insulin drip. Her AG normalized following
insulin drip and she was restarted on her home glargine and
sliding scale confirmed with [**Last Name (un) **] consultation. Etiology of
elevated [**Last Name (un) **] sugars remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] infectious w/u
negative. In addition, podiatry felt that her right toe lesion
was not infected. Possible etiologies include poor PO intake and
reduced insulin dosing [**3-18**] vomiting and headache caused by her
high BP. Admission HA1C 8.0. She was discharged with [**Month/Day (2) **]
sugars between 88-139 with keto dip sticks and an emergency
glucagon kit and [**Last Name (un) **] follow up.
.
#. Hypertensive Urgency: Etiology of acute increase in BP
despite medication unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] likely acute worsening of
chronically progressive diabetic macrovascular disease despite
recent medication increase. HA and N/V likely related to
elevated BP (consistent with prior episodes), CT negative for
acute intracranial process. Patient was restarted on home
verapamil and hydralazine but lisinopril was initially held [**3-18**]
elevated Cr. Her BP was in goal range (SBP 140-150) on transfer
from the ICU but increased to 180/100 on the morning of [**2150-8-5**].
Lisinopril was added back. Pt insisted on discharge despite
elevated [**Date Range **] pressures. The risks and benefits of leaving the
hospital including headache, nausea, worsening heart failure,
worsening kidney function and intracranial hemorrhage were
discussed with the patient; however, patient elected to leave on
her home verapamil, hydralazine and lisinopril with discharge
clinic f/u on Friday [**2150-8-7**].
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: Patient's presentation is
consistent with acute on chronic worsening of diastolic CHF (BNP
elevated >8000) with hypertension leading to increased
afterload, reduced filling and pulmonary and peripheral edema
that also likely contributed to patient's renal injury. Patient
was initially volume overloaded and received lasix in the ED and
ICU. On transfer to the floor patient appeared euvolemic with
clear lung exam and no peripheral edema so lasix was held in
light of her worsening renal function. This can be re-addressed
at [**Hospital 1944**] clinic appointment.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Pt's Cr was 1.0 in
[**1-/2150**] worsening to 1.8 in the past 6 months, elevated to 2.8
on admission. Unclear etiology. Renal ultrasound [**3-/2150**] showed
worsening parenchymal disease, UPEP was normal. Most likely
multifactorial namely acute pre-renal azotemia (admission BUN:Cr
~20:1) [**3-18**] hypertension, poor PO, and osmotic diuresis from DKA,
coupled with sub-acute worsening of intrinsic renal disease [**3-18**]
T1DM and HTN. Pt initially received gentle lasix diuresis to
euvolemia. Urine output remained adequate, u/a positive for
glucose, ketones and protein, negative for infection. Her
lisinopril was initially held but then restarted as her BP
elevated. Her outpatient nephrologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and will
follow up with her one week after discharge.
.
# Elevated troponin: Pt had troponin elevated to 0.07 on
admission  most likely secondary to demand ischemia from
increased afterload in hypertensive urgency and worsened by
decreased renal clearance. Pt was asx with negative EKGs;
however, troponins were trended given her high risk as a
diabetic and possibility of atypical chest pain with neuropathy.
Repeat troponins stablized, CK-MB were trended and negative.
.
#. Hypoxia: Mild hypoxemia in the ED in the context of patient
anxiety as well as hypertension, increasing afterload on chronic
diastolic HF (BNP >8000) leading to pulmonary vascular
congestion (confirmed on CXR). Oxygenation improved on arrival
in the MICU, where she received mild lasix diuresis, and
resolved on arrival to the floor.
.
# Rt Toe Lesion: Toe showed no signs of drainage or pus, no
erythema noted. FXR was negative for osteo. Podiatry consulted
and recommended dry sterile dressing with clinic follow up if
patient developed symptoms.
.
# Cataracts: Continued on Prednisone, vigamox and ciprofloxacin
eye gtt
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on home synthroid dose.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Mood stable. Continued on Fluoxetine and
risperdone.
.
# Neuropathy: continued home gabapentin
.
# Gastroparesis: Diabetic diet with home reglan PRN.
.
# Code: FULL CODE
.
# Transitional Issues:
- patient to follow-up in post discharge clinic for BP and
glycemic control monitoring
- will need electrolytes checked at post discharge clinic as
well
- volume status and renal function will need assessment at post
discharge clinic as well, as her lasix was held on discharge,
may need to be restarted
- patient provided with number for podiatry for right toe lesion
if any signs of worsening

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You came in with high [**Hospital1 **] sugars, and high
[**Hospital1 **] pressure, which caused nausea, vomiting and some damage to
your kidneys. We admitted you to the intensive care unit so that
we could give you continuous insulin and carefully monitor your
[**Hospital1 **] sugars. We also gave you medications to decrease your
[**Hospital1 **] pressure and fluids to help your kidneys. Your sugars
improved on the insulin and, with the help of your doctors [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**Name5 (PTitle) 4372**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **], we transitioned you to your home [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
medicines.
   Your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressue slightly improved, but remained elevated
on discharge. We discussed that we would prefer to keep you in
the hospital given your elevated [**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressure, but you decided
against this. We discussed the risks of leaving the hospital
with an elevated [**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressure with you and you felt that you
still would like to leave.
.
On discharge, please continue to hold your furosemide (lasix)
and address this on Friday, during your post discharge clinic
appointment.
.
Please continue to bandage your toe in dry sterile gauze as the
podiatry doctors have [**Name5 (PTitle) **] during your admission. You can
continue to care for the wound yourself but please call them at
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4335**] if you develop pain, redness, swelling or
drainage from the toe.

Chief Complaint:
Arm tingling, numbness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left internal carotid artery stent placement.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5936**] is a 60 yo M w/PMHx sx for CAD s/p CABG ([**2103**]), DM,
hyperlipidemia, HTN who presents with right arm tingling,
numbness, and difficulty closing his hand into a fist upon
wakening this morning.
.
Patient has known CAD, and is asymptomatic with his heart
disease. He has yearly stress tests, and states that his stress
test in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year was abnormal. He does note gradual
increase in his exertional dyspnea over the course of the past
year, and this past Thursday, developed a sharp midsternal chest
pain, without associated nausea, diaphoresis, radiation, or SOB,
relieved by SL nitro. He then saw his cardiologist on [**Month (only) 2974**],
who performed an echo, and requested that he have a repeat
catheterization done this Wednesday. Patient then developed the
right arm tingling and presented to the OSH ED ([**Hospital3 **]).


Patient has chronic visual blurriness from cataracts. He has
chronic numbness and swelling of his legs from Charcot foot.
.
Of note, he had left arm shaking for 20 minutes one week ago
after having lifted his arm during house work. Disappeared on
its own. No tingling or weakness associated.
.
Patient was initially seen at an OSH, with an unchanged EKG,
negative head CT (per pt), and was given aspirin, plavix load,
nitroglycerin, and started on a heparin gtt. His first set of CE
there were negative. He was then transferred here where his sx
did not seem compatible with ACS, and his heparin gtt was
discontinued.
.
On admission, the patient denied any CP, SOB, palpitations,
tingling/pain/numbness in his arms, trauma to his neck or arm.

circulation to the right posterior cerebral artery. There is a
hypoplastic right A1 segment.
IMPRESSION: Normal time-of-flight MRA of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
.
Carotid ultrasound: Significant left-sided plaque with 80-99%
carotid stenosis. Of note, this extends fairly distally in the
cervical internal carotid artery. On the right, there is less
than 40% carotid stenosis.
.
MR spine: Right paracentral and foraminal disc herniation at
C6-7 could be causing neural impingement. This would correlate
with patient's clinical symptoms. Mild degenerative changes
otherwise.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5936**] is a 60 yo M w/PMHx sx for CAD s/p CABG, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, and DM who presents with sharp shooting pain
down arm concerning for TIA.  hosp course by problem:
.
# Neuro/TIA:  Patinet had neuro workup as above.  He was
evaluated by neurology and sx were concerning for a TIA.  Given
the carotid findings it was deemed that the source of the TIA
was likely carotid in origin.  He was taken to the cath lab for
stent placement in the left ICA on [**6-1**].  Procedure was
tolerated well without complication.  He was monitored in the
CCU postprocedure.  His groin site was stable and his neuro exam
remained nonfocal.  He was treated with a nitro gtt temporarily
given that many of his antihypertensives had been on hold.  This
was weaned as his meds were titrated up.  His goal SBP was
110-170 given recent carotid manipulation.  After remaining
stable overnight, he was evaluated by neuro again and there were
no deficits.  He was stable for d/c to home.  He has f/u with
neuro/stroke attng within one month.
.
#. Cardiac.
a. Ischemia. Patient's EKG without active ischemic changes, and
CE negative. However per patient report abnormal stress and
scheduled for cath this week given SSCP last Thursday, relieved
by SL nitro.  The cath was put on hold given neuro workup.
Patient will f/u with cardiologist and will likely have elective
cath in 1 month.  We continued ASA 325, Plavix, metoprolol,
statin
b. Rhythm. NSR. Monitor on telemetry.
c. Pump. euvolemic. EF 50% on last Echo in [**11-23**].
.
#. HTN. His home meds were adjusted pre-stent to allow for some
autoregulation.  Postprocedure, we gradually added back some
antihypertensives but held the HCTZ and verapamil on discharge
given the new carotid stent will likely decrease BP.  He will
have close f/u with his PCP and will contact him sooner if
develops dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, or low BP on
self-exam.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia. Continued statin.
.
#. DM2. Continued home insulin.
.
#. CRI. GFR 54. Cr 1.3-1.4 and stable.  He received pre-carotid
stent hydration
.
#. Dispo status: well.  ambulating without issue.  no neuro
deficits.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of left ICA stent


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 60 yo M hx CAD s/p CABG ([**2103**] at [**Hospital1 112**]), DM II,
hyperlipidemia, HTN recent admission 2 weeks prior for TIA sxs
(right arm tingling, numbness, and difficulty making a fist),
found to have 80-99% left carotid stenosis s/p stent.  A
self-expanding carotid stent was placed with 50% residual
stenosis after stenting.  2 days prior to admission, patient
developed transient episode of blurry vision and ""speaking
gibberish.""  He was initially admitted to the Neurology service
then found to left caudate infarct and persistent stenosis of
the ICA on CT neck and carotid ultrasound.  He underwent repeat
angiography and the self-expanding stent was in place but had
expanded over the stenotic area.  An additional stent was placed
by Interventional Cardiology and he was transferred to the CCU
for close hemodynamic monitoring.
.
Of note, patient also with known CAD with DOE over the past year
and episodes of chest pain, had outpatient stress [**1-25**] with
reported new inf/inf-lat wall motion abnormalities.  Plan was
for eventual revascularization after further work-up and
stenting of carotids.
.
On review of symptoms, he has had prior TIA sxs as noted above.
No deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He has had DOE for
the past year and plan for eventual cath, he has had exertional
chest pain in the past.

MRA Brain/Neck [**2113-6-21**]:
Apparent stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid may be
artifactual secondary to susceptibility artifact from the stent;
however, this is unclear without the administration of
gadolinium. Repeat imaging with MRA with gadolinium or CTA can
be pursued as clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  60 yo M hx CAD s/p CABG ([**2103**] at [**Hospital1 112**]), DM II,
hyperlipidemia, HTN, recent Left carotid stent placed presented
with TIA symptoms, and found to have reocclusion of left carotid
stent.
.
# Carotid stenosis: second stent placed in left carotid with
good effect. The patient was stable until the evening of [**6-23**]/7
when he had a vagal episode when his sheath was being pulled.
His [**Date Range **] decreased to the 120s, and the patient began to have
some difficulty with word-finding. Speech was noted to be slower
than usual. The episode lasted ~2minutes with stable vital
signs. Neurology was consulted felt that this may have been a
re-expression of his existing left caudate infarct from low BP.
They recommended no change in management. Throughout the
admission the patient was maintained on ASA, plavix, niacin, and
zetia. He was also started on simvastain 40mg despite history of
myalgias for about 1 month until outpatient follow-up. Neurology
continued to follow the patient throughout his hospital course
and arranged for follow-up as an outpatient.
.
# HTN: the restenting procedure was complicated by acute
evlevation in BP, so nipride and NTG gtt were started. These
were weaned off and additional anti-hypertensives were held so
that [**Date Range **] could be within goal of 145-180. Po metoprolol was
restarted on [**6-25**].
-upon discharge, the patient was instructed to measure his BP
twice daily and to follow-up with his doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is
persistently < 130.
- Additional andi-hypertensives are to be re-started as an
outpatient.
.
# anemia: on [**2113-6-24**] the patient's hematocrit, which was
previously stable around 40, dropped to 31.7. There was no
evidence of hematoma on clinical exam. A CT of the abdomen and
pelvis was done to r/o RP bleed and returned negative. Anemia
resolved by [**6-25**] with a return to baseline ~40).
.
# DM: HgA1c A1c 8.6 (pt states lower than prior in the mid-9's).
The patient was maintained on a RISS and his home NPH regimen
when not NPO.
.
During the admission the patient was maintained on a cardiac,
diabetic diet with a PPI and sc heparin for prophylaxis. He was
discharged in good condition with VSS to home.

Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular line placement
right tunneled line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61yo male with a past medical history significant
for CAD s/p CABG in [**2102**], HIV, hepatitis B and C, who presented
to the ED with bradycardia to the 30s. The patient reports that
he was in his baseline state of health until about 24 hours
prior to admission, when he began to feel SOB. He also reports
that he had chest pressure for about the day prior to admission,
which was relieved with administration of oxygen in the
ambulance. The patient reports taht he has been eating a lot of
potatoe chips lately. He denies use of heroin and cocaine since
mid-[**Month (only) 359**]. Notably, the patient is somnolent and it is
difficult to obtain a throrough history although he does answer
questions appropriately. He denies cough, fevers, [**Month (only) 28877**], sore
throat, rhinorrhea, headache, ear pain, sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] says
that he is able to walk down his hallway and is not able to walk
up stairs, limited by shortness of breath. He denies orthopnea.
He denies recent travel, no hiking and no tick bites.

In the ED, the patient was initially bradycardic to the 30s and
initially normotensive, but his pressures then dropped to
systolic 70s. Bedside ultrasound was performed which showed no
pericardial effusion and poor ventricular squeeze. Fingerstick
was 99. The patient was given atropine 1mg without change. There
was concern for beta blocker vs calcium channel  blocker
overdose and the patient was given glucagon 5mg PO with zofran.
The patient vomited in response. A cordis was placed in the RIJ
and a dopamine drip was started which increased her HR to 50s
and SBP to 100. A CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions,
unable to exclude pna. The patient was started on broad spectrum
abx for presumed pna. The patient did receive about 1L of NS.
Throughout the patient's time in the ED, he was mentating well.

Labs are notable for creatinine 4.2 (baseline 1.5), troponin
0.03, lactate 3 and potassium 6.1 repeat K is 4.2.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, [**Name (NI) 28877**] or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

ECHO [**12-25**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**1-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2110-5-10**], the tricuspid regurgitation appears worse, and
the right ventricle is dilated.

CXR [**12-25**] Moderate-to-large loculated right pleural effusion
appears increased in size from prior exam. Moderate left pleural
effusion is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities likely represent
atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
Mild pulmonary edema.

CXR [**12-25**] Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour
earlier.
Right IJ catheter sheath tip is at the distal/lower right
jugular vein.
Cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate right and small-to-moderate
left pleural
effusions with adjacent bibasilar atelectases are unchanged.
Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Multiple surgical clips
project over the left cardiac border. Several leads and external
monitors are noted.

KUB [**12-28**] ileus

Right UE duplex US [**12-28**] No DVT.

CXR: [**1-5**]
PA and lateral views of the chest. A right internal jugular
hemodialysis catheter ends in the low SVC. Sternotomy wires and
mediastinal clips are seen. Bilateral layering pleural effusions
are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Bibasilar atelectasis. There is decreased interstitial edema and
pulmonary vascular congestion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral layering pleural effusions. Decreased
pulmonary edema.
2. No evidence for pneumonia or active or nonactive
tuberculosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yo male with past medical history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HLD,
diabetes, HIV, hepatitis C and B who is presented with
bradycardia, bilateral pleural effusions, concern for PNA by
chest imaging and acute on chronic renal failure.

ACUTE CARE:
# BRADYCARDIA - The patient initially presented with bradycardia
in a junctional rhythm and hypotension. With dopamine, the
patient's junctional rhythm converted to sinus bradycardia.  All
home antihypertensives were discontinued, Echo showed EF of 65%
which was improved from prior.  His HR and [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure
increased with dopamine, which he was eventually weaned off. The
patient's bradycardia is of unclear etiology. The most likely
etiology is the possibility of a toxin which was in the heroin
he used 2 days prior to admission.  Bradycardia resolved
spontaneously and patient was able to be started on [**1-26**] dose
metoprolol.

# ELEVATED PULMONARY ARTERY PRESSURES, RIGHT VENTRICULAR
DYSFUNCTION ?????? Question of elevated PA pressures on echo but
Right heart cath did not show evidence of right heart failure or
pulm HTN. [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA were negative.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - patient with chronic renal
insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 likely secondary
to poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes.  Ceatinine on
presentation elevated to [**8-1**] with muddy casts on urinalysis and
no evidence of active sediment.  Acute renal failure was
attributed to ATN from hypotension in the setting of poor
forward flow.  Tenofovir was also discontinued given possible
cytotoxic nephrogenic effect.  Medications were renally dosed.
Nephrology was consulted and although patient initially refused
HD, dialysis was eventually initiated due to metabolic
abnormalities and uremia.  Although urine output slowly improved
through hospital course, patient remained with marginal GFR and
gross fluid overload.  A tunneled line was placed with the plan
to continue dialysis as an outpatient.  Hepatitis B surface
Antigen was negative (core antibody positive, viral load in
[**6-/2110**] was undetectable) and chest x-ray showed no evidence of
active Tuberculosis (hx of Tb s/p treatment).

# HIV: VL in [**9-/2110**] is 61 with CD4 count of 205, repeat VL
during hospitalization was 56. Due to renal function, HAART
regimen was held at time of presentation, and he was started on
a drug holiday. Management of his HAART regimen will be
difficult given his resistance and his renal failure. Atovaquone
ppx was initiated given low CD4 count.  Patient will follow up
with outpatient physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 438**], to discuss possible
HAART regimens.

# Thrombocytopenia: baseline platelet count is 100, trended down
to 48 during hospitalization. Heparin was discontinued and
evaluation for TTP, DIC and HIT were negative.  Acute decrease
in platelet count was felt to be secondary to acute illness.
Platelet count improved spontaneously and heparin was
reinitiated.  At time of discharge, platlet count had improved
to baseline of 120s.

# Diabetes: HgA1C was 7.9% in [**2110-6-25**]. Home regimen:  70/30
40U subq qam and 30 U subq qpm.  Given new onset renal failure,
insulin dose was reduced by [**1-26**] and gradually titrated to
achieve euglycemia.  At time of discharge, patient was taking
70/30 30U qam and 20U qpm.  If patient remains hyperglycemic, he
was instructed to increase dose by 2U and call endocrinologist
at [**Last Name (un) **].

# LOOSE STOOLS ?????? While patient was on broad spectrum abx (see
below), patient was noted to have copious loose stools.  Cdiff
toxins was negative and change in bowel movements was attibuted
to antibiotic associated diarrhea.  Bowel regimen was held and
patient developed relative constipation with KUB consistent with
ileus.  Ileus was managed conservatively with uptitrated bowel
regimen, and by time of discharge, bowel movements had returned
to normal.

# (?) PNEUMONIA - On presentation, patient complained of dyspnea
with CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia could not
be excluded. Given initial presentation with hypotension,
patient was empirically covered with broad spectrum antibiotics
of vanc/ zosyn.  As clinical status improved, all antibiotics
were discontinued.  Respiratory status improved with initiation
of dialysis and fluid removal.

CHRONIC CARE:
# Polysubstance abuse: admitted to recent heroine use last on
[**12-22**], denies recent cocaine use. Urine tox screen positive for
opiates.  Patient was seen by social work and counseled on drug
cessation

# CAD s/p CABG in [**2102**]. As above, there was no evidence of
ischemia per EKGs or repeat Echo.  Patient had reportedly not
been taking his aspirin at home.

# HTN: the patient has a history of hypertension but was
hypotensive during his hospital stay.  Metoprolol, felodipine,
valsartan, lisinopril, spironolactone were discontinued.  [**Year (4 digits) **]
pressure stablized with SBP 110-130s and patient was able to be
re-initiated on metoprolol XL 50mg.

# Hyperlipidemia: lipids well controlled in 6/[**2110**]. Continued
pravastatin.

# Neuropathic pain: Continue amitriptyline 10mg tablet qhs prn
pain.

# Hepatitis C: chronic, stable, untreated.  LFTs remained normal
throughout stay, INR is elevated and albumin is low.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for very slow heart rate and low
[**Hospital1 **] pressure. You were admitted to the ICU because you
required a medication to support your heart. Your kidneys began
to decline and you were advised to initiate dialysis. You were
not able to take your HAART medications for HIV because of your
poor renal function. You were also treated for a pneumonia. It
is unclear what caused all of these symptoms but it may be
related to your drug use. It is of the utmost importance that
you do not continue to use drugs. It is also very important that
you quit smoking cigarettes.

Unfortunately your kidney function did not recover significantly
during your hospital course to allow you to come off of
dialysis.  You had to have a catheter placed to receive dialysis

kidney function may still improve over the upcoming months.

Please note the following changes to your medications:
STOP your HAART medications: darunavir, emtricitabine-
tenofovir, ritonavir
STOP lisinopril
STOP felodipine
STOP valsartan
STOP torsemide
STOP spironolactone
DECREASE your metoprolol succinate to 50mg daily
DECREASE your insulin to 30units in the morning and 20units in
the evening
DECREASE your aspirin to 81mg daily
START nephrocaps daily
START atovaquone daily
You may take senna and colace as needed for constipation
Only take the medications that are listed on your discharge
paperwork

Please be sure to follow up with your physicians.

Brief Hospital Course:
27yo M with Type I DM and gastroparesis presented with DKA. He
was on insulin drip for several day for aggressive control of
anion gap. He remained nauseous and unable to take po intake
until the anion gap is well controlled. IV fluid with dextrose
was used while patient was NPO. As soon as the anion gap was
well controlled, patient resumed extremely good appetite and was
able to be transitioned to sc insulin [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] reccomendation.
Of note, patient also has domented gastroparesis on gastric
emptying study and this also may have contributed to the nausea.
Reglan was increased, LFTs and Ultrasound of the abdomen were
normal.

Of note, he was also hypertensive with sbp running 170-180
systolic. He was on ACE inhibitor a few years ago according to
[**Last Name (un) 387**] records but has discontinued that due to insurance issue.
ACE inhibitor was restarted while he was in the hospital.

Social work consult was obtained to help him handle the medical
insurance issue. As mentioned above, he had not seen a doctor
for years and has discontinued/not compliant with medication.

On the day of discharge, patient insisted on leaving. The ICU
team explained to him that he had just been transitioned to sc
insulin at that time and would need to stay for the afternoon
for observation. He seem to have understood at the time of
discussion and was very agreeable. However, he left without
telling any medical staff shortly after that. Effort was made to
contact him by phone but to no avail .

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the intensive care unit because you were
hypoglycemic (had very low blood sugar) because of your type 1
diabetes.  We started you on an insulin trip.  In addition, you
were nauseous and vomiting, probably related to gastroparesis
(slow intestinal movements) related to your type 1 diabetes, and
we gave you medications to help your intestines move.  Finally,
we found that you had very high blood pressures, and we gave you
medications to lower your blood pressure.
.
We have started you on some new medications:
.
# For your nausea and vomiting: Metoclopramide 10 mg.  Take one
tablet before meals and at bedtime every day.
.
# For your high blood pressure:
1.  Toprol XL 200mg daily: Take 200 mg daily in the mornings.
2.  Amlodipine 10mg daily: Take 10mg daily in the mornings.
.
# For your insulin:  We have written a prescription for an
insulin pen for you to inject your NPH insulin.  You should
inject 20 units NPH at every breakfast, and another 20 units NPH
at every bedtime.  We have DECREASED your insulin dosage ONLY
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT EATING A FULL DIET YET.  Once you start
eating a full diet, you should return to using your 40 units NPH
at every breakfast, and another 40 units NPH at every bedtime.
.
We have ***STOPPED*** your lisinopril 5mg daily because of your
kidney function.  Please follow up with the kidney doctor
mentioned below to determine whether you should restart it.
.
Otherwise, we have not changed your medications.
.
We have made several appointments for you.  Please keep these
appointments.

   Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2143-4-8**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] AT 2120 ON [**4-8**]..
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Hematemesis:  Resolved spontaneously, GI team evaluated pt and
felt that GI bleed was likely due to known gastritis vs possible
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears.  Hct remained stable.

2)Acute renal failure: Creatinine was 2.6 on presentation.  No
hydronephrosis by ultrasound.  Given pt's sense of thirst,
possible pre-renal from hypovolemia, IV fluids to be bolued and
creatinine rechecked.  Given that on arrival to general medicine
floor he had lost IV access. Urine lytes were sent.  No evidence
of volume overload.  A CPK was checked which was markedly
elevated after being transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The patient
was given aggressive IVF once IV access was obtained.  On the
night of discharge the patient stated he did not want further
treatment and signed out AMA.  He was deemed competent to make
his decision by the moonlighting physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that evening
the microlab called the moonlighter to say he had a positive
blood cx with GPC (see results above).  This was deemed a
possible contaminant but the patient was called and instructed
to return to the ER for further evaluation.  Two messages were
left on the patient's phone.

3)Hypertension, benign: Pt presented initially with hypertensive
urgency, better controlled now on home medication of amlodopine
10 mg daily, and Toprol 200 mg daily.

4)Diabetes Mellitus type 1, uncontrolled with complications:
Giving smaller dose of standing insulin than he is on at home
due to his acute renal failure.  Treat with NPH.  He was given
NPH 40 units in ICU [**4-6**] pm and had FSBG of 27 in the morning of
[**4-7**].

Medications on Admission:
# Amlodipine 10 mg daily

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ER on [**2-18**], his vitals were: T 100.1, P 98, BP 164/90, RR
16, O2 sat 100%.  He had abdominal pain, and he was guiac
negative. His initial creatinine was 15.3, his glucose was 162,
and he had a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 24 (up from
his baseline of 19, due to his chronic kidney disease). He was
given 2L IVF for hydration, and his anion gap closed to 20. He
was given morphine 4 mg IV x 2 and zofran 4 mg IV x 2, and
admitted to medicine. On transfer to the floor his vitals were:
T 99.2, HR 100, BP 171/90, RR 12, O2sat 97% on room air.
.
On the medicine floor he had worsening nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain, his glucose rose to 305, his gap increased to 21
and his pH was 7.27. He received another 2 liters of normal
saline, but become tachypneic. His tachypnea resolved with
diuresis (Lasix 20 mg IV). On [**2-19**] the patient was transferred
to the MICU for an insulin drip and management of DKA. He
received 2 liters of D5W in normal saline, then 1 liter of D5W
with 3 amps of bicarb, then 1 liter of D5W with K+. For his
hematocrit of 20 he received 1 unit of pRBCs. His gap was back
down to 21 by 23:00 that evening.

On [**2-20**] the patient had his first session of hemodialysis. He
declined his renal diet all day, then at midnight had [**State 19827**]
Fried Chicken brought in from outside. In the early AM of [**2-21**]
he developed nausea, vomiting, a glucose of 436 and DKA. He had
an EKG that showed no ischemia, and morphine for pain. For
systolic blood pressures from 190-210 he received IV doses of
his home PO antihypertensives (Hydralazine and Metoprolol). The
patient was refusing his calcium capsules because they were too
big to swallow, and tried to order a pizza in instead of
hospital food.

By [**2-24**] he had been transitioned from insulin drip to insulin
boluses. On [**2-25**] he had his 4th session of dialysis. He wanted
to leave that evening AMA (felt he had lost his freedom), but
was convinced to stay. On [**2-26**] he again wanted to leave AMA but
was again convinced to stay one more day for a 5th dialysis
session and to arrange optimal outpatient followup. He was
transferred out of the ICU to the medicine floor.

Overnight on [**3-31**], he [**Date Range 28316**] a fever to 100.9.  Blood
cultures were sent and he underwent his 5th dialysis session.
Following his HD session, he was seen by the medical team and
advised to stay in the hospital for one more day to assess for
an infection, given his overnight fever and recent initiation of
hemodialysis.  He was advised to stay to ensure he remained
afebrile for 24 hours.  Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] refused this advise and
decided to sign out AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE, despite repeated
discussions with him regarding our decision and desire to
monitor him for another day.

By problem:
Anion gap metabolic acidosis/hyperglycemia/DKA.  Increased above
baseline on presentation probably due to uremia in setting of
dehydration. It slightly improved s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap
of 19. But after brief stay on the regular medicine floor, his
blood sugar elevated into the 200-300s and anion gap increased;
acetone found in serum and ketones seen in urinalysis,
concerning for DKA. Lactate was normal. In the MICU, patient was
started on an insulin gtt and started on intravenous fluids. In
total, patient received 2L D51/2NS, then D5W with 3 amps bicarb
in 1L, then D5W with potassium. He had a PICC placed for regular
(every 4 hour) electrolyte checks. Patient's anion gap decreased
to baseline ~17, given patient's underlying end-stage renal
disease/uremia. Insulin gtt was discontinued and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
recs, patient was started on a fixed Lantus and Humalog sliding
scale. Of note, on [**2-20**], patient refused hospital diet
and had his girlfriend bring him [**State 19827**] Fried Chicken; his
blood sugars and anion gap increased. Patient required
resumption of insulin gtt briefly; he was resumed on insulin
sliding scale and fixed dose, with Nutrition Consult and Social
Work following for coping/management of his long-standing,
complicated Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

N/V/D, abdominal pain.  Given low grade fever and acute onset,
most c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this was
exacerbated by uremia. Also, patient has a hx of gastroparesis.
Abdominal exam nonfocal but with tenderness initially that
resolved. Did have an episode of resumed, increased abdominal
pain after consumption of KFC, likely due to brief opening of
anion gap and underlying gastroparesis. Lipase was normal. Mild
elevation of LFTs gradually resolved. Pt did not appear fluid
overloaded on exam. Patient's diarrhea resolved while in MICU
and as per above, developed appetite and was able to tolerate PO
medications/diet. Clostridium difficile toxin was sent and
negative

Acute on chronic renal failure.  Pt was already in end stage
renal disease (stage 4) on admission. AV fisulta had been
recently placed for initiation of hemodialysis. In the setting
of profuse nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, there was also likely
a prerenal component to the bump in creatinine. Patient received
2L intravenous fluids in the ED and then approximately 4L to
manage his DKA. Patient did become hypertensive likely in this
setting. Patient was continued on calcitriol, calcium acetate,
and nephrotoxic medications were avoided. Renal followed the
patient during this admission and initiated hemodialysis with
good effect on his creatinine and volume status.

Anemia.  Initially on arrival to the MICU, hematocrit was 20,
mildly below baseline of 25 and felt due to the combination of
iron deficiency and CKD. Patient did not have emesis or blood in
his stools. Patient was transfused one unit of pRBC with good
effect. He was continued on iron supplements and may benefit
from Epogen with hemodialysis in the future.

HTN.  Poorly controlled, likely in the setting of initial acute
discomfort and later due to volume overload in the setting of
his ESRD and intravenous fluids for DKA. Patient was ultimately
transitioned to a regimen of Metoprolol 100mg twice daily,
Amlodipine 10mg daily and Hydralazine 50mg three times daily.

Fever.  Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a fever to 100.9 on the night of
[**3-31**].  As discussed above, in the setting of recent
initiation of hemodialysis and pending blood cultures, the
patient was advised to remain in the hospital to be sure he was
afebrile for 24 hours, without signs or symptoms of infection,
and that his blood cultures remained negative.  Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**]
refused, and signed out AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.

Discharge Instructions:
*LEAVING AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE*

You were admitted to the hospital for nausea and vomiting.
While in the hospital, your sugars were elevated and you were
found to have Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).  You were treated
with an insulin drip and your DKA initially resolved.  However,
you were not compliant with your diabetic diet and after eating
fried chicken you redeveloped signs of DKA requiring a second
insulin drip.  You developed further episodes of DKA during your
hospitalization and each required insulin drip in the intensive
care unit.  Additionally, during this hospitalization you were
initiated on hemodialysis which you will require three times a
week.  You [**Known lastname 28316**] a fever on [**2-24**] and again on [**2-27**], and blood
cultures were taken to evaluate for any signs of blood
infection.  These must be followed by your primary care doctor
or your outpatient nephrologist.  Given your recent initiation
of hemodialysis and lengthy hospital course, we advise you to
remain in the hospital while we await the results of these
cultures.  As you have decided to leave, it will be AGAINST
MEDICAL ADVICE as we strongly believe that you should continue
to be evaluated for signs and potential sources of infection
given your recent fevers.  We want to ensure that you did not
have an active infection and do not have fevers over the next 24
hours.

We made the following changes to your home medications:
Hydralazine 50 mg TID (you were taking 25 mg TID prior)
Metoprolol Tartrate 100 [**Hospital1 **] (you were on a long acting
metoprolol once daily prior)

Please also follow the attached printout of sliding scale
insulin dosing based on your blood sugars.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
32 y/o M with hx of DM I, HTN, ESRD on HD (last HD yesterday
with uneventful full run).  Today had sudden onset SOB when he
woke up.  Felt positional and was improved with sitting up and
worsened with lying down.  Also then had symptoms with diarrhea
and vomiting a few hours after waking up.  They were
non-bilious, non-bloody emesis and diarrhea.  His SOB continued
and he felt as if he had a tight feeling in his chest.  Also
felt some tightness substernally.  No fevers, chills.  Did have
some sweats recently, but had otherwise been feeling well and
healthy since his last discharge for n/v and gastroparesis.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.4, 203/116, 114 NSR, 40,
85% RA.  Overall, mildly uncomfortable and working to breath,
rales bilaterally.  Had soft, distended, non-tender abdomen.
Refused guiac exam.  He received vanco, zosyn, and levo for
potential pna.  Also received an ASA.  Started on nitro gtt for
hypertension.  Renal aware of patient and that he received
contrast for his CTA.
.
On transfer from the ED, his vitals were 181/107, 124, 25, 97%
NRB (was 90 on 6L).  He was mildly uncomfortable.  He is
complaining of shortness of breath and a headache.  His nausea
is mostly improved.  He otherwise is comfortable on 6L NC.
.
In the MICU, he had CTA which was negative for PE and consistent
with pulmonary edema so antibiotics were discontinued. He
received a one time dose of lasix 20 IV with good UOP and BP
improved on home regimen as he was weaned off nitro drip and
down to 2L O2 by NC. At time of transfer, he reports SOB much
improved and denies any current CP.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2145-3-21**]
Final Report
EXAM: Chest frontal, single AP upright portable view.
Large areas of airspace opacity involving the right mid-to-lower
lung, likely involving the right middle and lower lobes and
possibly the right upper lobe.  There is suggestion of small
bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiac silhouette remains
enlarged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lung airspace opacity concerning for infectious process
vs edema.  Recommend clinical correlation and followup to
resolution. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Persistent moderate cardiomegaly.

Radiology Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study
Date of [**2145-3-21**]  Final Report
CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST: The thoracic aorta is normal in
course and
caliber, without dissection. The pulmonary arteries opacify
normally, without evidence of pulmonary embolism. The main
pulmonary artery is enlarged, measuring 3.6 cm in diameter.
Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for
pathologic enlargement. There are extensive nodular opacities
involving all lobes of the lungs, mid lung and basal
predominant.  More confluent areas of airspace consolidation are
present centrally and dependently. There is interlobular septal
thickening, left greater than right. The airways are patent
bilaterally to the subsegmental level. There is a small right
pleural effusion and a moderate pericardial effusion. The heart
is enlarged. Enlarged prevascular and pretracheal mediastinal
lymph nodes are likely reactive. Anterior mediastinal soft
tissue density is likely residual thymus.

Imaging of the upper abdomen is unremarkable. There are no
concerning osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism. No aortic dissection.
2. Extensive nodular opacities throughout all lobes concerning
for infection. Confluent areas of airspace opacity may reflect
pulmonary edema or infection.  Septal thickening consistent with
interstitial pulmonary edema. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, may
be reactive.
3. Moderate pericardial effusion.
4. Small right pleural effusion.
5. Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2145-3-22**] at 9:30:00 AM      FINAL

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2144-2-14**].
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Low
normal LVEF. Estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal. Quantitative
biplane LVEF is 52%. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low
normal systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Small-moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-14**],
left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous and
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2142**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2145-3-22**]
Final Report
PORTABLE CHEST
FINDINGS: Previously identified asymmetrically distributed
opacities in the right lung have rapidly improved with only
minimal residual opacities,
predominantly in the right retrocardiac region. However, opacity
in the left retrocardiac area has slightly worsened. Small
pleural effusions are again demonstrated. Cardiac silhouette
remains enlarged and there is persistent increase in pulmonary
vascularity.

IMPRESSION:
1. Rapid improvement in right-sided alveolar opacities, which
may have been due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema or aspiration
considering the rapid improvement. Worsening opacities at left
base could reflect evolving
infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Enlarged cardiac silhouette with known pericardial effusion.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
--
Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2145-3-23**]
Final Report
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-22**]:
Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Small left pleural effusion is
new or newly
apparent. Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild though the upper
lobe vessels are clearly dilated and there is no pulmonary
edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
32yom w T1DM, ESRD on hemodialysis, HTN presented with sudden
onset dyspnea, likely due to flash pulmonary edema in setting of
severe hypertension.

# Shortness of breath: Presented w sudden onset dyspnea.  Most
likely due to flash pulmonary edema given severe HTN on
presentation, elevated BNP, CXR and CTA showing pulmonary edema
which rapidly resolved with blood pressure control.  Echo showed
new findings of mild LV systolic dysfunction (EF 52%), moderate
pulmonary artery HTN, and small-moderate circumferential
pericardial effusion (previously seen on CT abd [**2145-3-6**]).
Troponins cycled every 8 hours were 0.10, 0.12, 0.12, consistent
with demand ischemia in setting of renal failure without concern
for an acute ischemic event. EKG on admission was unchanged from
prior. CTA was negative for PE. Initially, CXR had infiltrate
concerning for PNA, so pt was started on antibiotics for
hospital acquired PNA.  However, these were discontinued after
rapid improvement of CXR with diuresis.  In the MICU, pt was
treated with a nitro drip, lasix (with good urine output), and
supplmental O2 via nasal cannula.  On transfer to the floor,
lungs were wheezy and pt sated 91%-95% on 2-4L NC.  After
hemodialysis, lungs were clear, and pt sated 95-100% on room
air. Although patient had low grade temperatures (99.0), he did
not develop localizing symptoms or leukocytosis concerning for
health care acquired pneumonia. Given good urine output despite
being on hemodialysis, patient was started on 80mg daily of
Lasix PO by Renal upon discharge.
.
# Hypertension: SBP in 200s on arrival in setting of medication
noncompliance secondary to PO intolerance.  Placed on nitro drip
until tolerating POs, at which point home antihypertensives
(hydralazine, lisinopril, metoprolol) were restarted. SBP ranged
120s-170s on floor with some improvement after dialysis as well.

.
# End stage renal failure: Renal followed patient, and he was
able to remain on his regular T/Th/Sat dialysis schedule while
in house.
.
# Nausea/Vomiting: Etiology for nausea and vomiting unclear,
although likely from gastroparesis as noted in previous
admissions. Was given zofran and reglan PRN with good control of
symptoms.
.
# Pulmonary Hypertension: Increased PASP new since last TTE and
slightly decreased LVEF compared with 2/09 as well as BNP [**Numeric Identifier 14123**]
all suggest left heart failure as etiology of pulmonary
hypertension. Patient should consider further work-up as
outpatient (rheum, LFTs, HIV, right heart cath...)
.
# Pericardial Effusion: likely secondary to renal failure.
Unchanged based on findings on CT scan. Pulsus < 10 without
signs of tamponade.
.
# Anemia: On transfer to MICU, Hct was 27, which was above
baseline of 23. Thought to be secondary to volume contraction in
the setting of nause and vomiting. With improvement of
nausea/vomiting his hematocrit trended back to his baseline of
23. No clinical evidence of bleeding during his stay.
.
# Transaminitis: On admission, mildly elevated AST and ALT in
70s. Alk phos was normal. Unclear etiology, but perhaps
secondary to hepatic congestion in setting of flash pulmonary
edema. Had normal ultrasound last admission. Liver function
tests were trended and came down with improvement in his
clinical status.
.
# Type I Diabetes: Complicated by nephropathy, neuropathy and
gastroparesis. Remained on insulin sliding scale and home lantus
dose. Blood sugar ranged from 161-204. No anion gap on routine
labs to suggest ketoacidosis.

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 32 yo M w/hx of DM type I, ESRD on HD who
presents with shortness of breath and hypoxemia.  Patient has
been in usual state of health.  On Thursday morning he noticed
he was more short of breath.  Went to HD yesterday and completed
session w/o events (w/ 1.6L ultrafiltration).  Unfortunately,
yesterday afternoon/evening developed progressive shortness of
breath worst when lying flat.  No reported fevers, chills, night
sweats, productive cough or other complaints.  No sick contacts,
recent travel.  To patient feels similar to previous admission
in [**Month (only) 958**] when he had dyspnea related to volume overload.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T99.4 HR 98 BP 185/108 RR18 100.
Initial impression was for pulmonary edema in setting of
diastolic dysfunction and hypertensive urgency.  Was given oral
medications/home regimen for treatment of BP.  CT Chest
performed that excluded PE, and showed stable ground glass
opacities.  Read of CT Chest concerning for infection rather
than volume overload, and patient was covered in ED with vanco.
Zosyn held given PCN allergy.  Renal contact[**Name (NI) **] who saw patient
and planning HD on arrival to floor.
.
Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient's VS were: HR 91, 153/86
100% NRB, RR 20.

IMAGES/STUDIES:
.
CXR [**2145-4-16**]:
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY: There is increased opacity in the
bilateral lungs, which appears more severe at the right base.
This is diffuse and nonfocal, and suggests a diffuse airspace
process. There is no pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
The cardiac contour is enlarged and globular, in keeping with
known pericardial effusion. The mediastinal contour is otherwise
unremarkable. The visualized bones and the upper abdomen
demonstrate no acute abnormality.
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette, in keeping with known
pericardial effusion.
2. New diffuse airspace opacities, which appears more severe
than right.  Lack pleural effusions argue against volume
overload, and a diffuse infectious process is considered more
likely. Other etiologies, including hemorrhage, are not
excluded.
.
CTA [**2145-4-16**]:
FINDINGS: The aorta is normal in caliber and configuration, with
no evidence for acute aortic syndrome. There is adequate
opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree, with no evidence
of filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. The main
pulmonary artery is again enlarged, suggesting pulmonary artery
hypertension. There is a moderate pericardial effusion, similar
in size to prior study. The heart is otherwise unremarkable.
Prominent prevascular and pretracheal mediastinal nodes are
again noted. In the lungs, there are diffuse ground-glass,
somewhat nodular opacity, seen predominantly in the lower lobes
with relative sparing of the apices. This is improved compared
to [**2145-3-21**]. More consolidative processes at the bases
have improved. While there is slight septal thickening,
suggesting that a component of this may represent pulmonary
edema, the lack of effusion argues against attributing this
strictly to volume overloada, and infectious etiologies remain
strong consideration. The trachea and central airways are patent
to the subsegmental level, without endobronchial lesions
identified. The esophagus appears normal. There is no acute
abnormality identified in the upper abdomen.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolism.
2. Extensive ground-glass, nodular opacities throughout both
lungs, most predominant in the lower lobes, remain most
concerning for infection. Other diagnostic considerations
include pulmonary edema (given history of renal failure and HTN)
or pulmonary hemorrhage. Findings are improved. There is
prominent pretracheal and prevascular lymph nodes again present,
possibly reactive.
3. Moderate pericardial effusion, stable.
4. Prominent main pulmonary artery, again suggestive of
pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 32 y/o M w/ DM, ESRD on HD, HTN who presents
with acute onset dyspnea and hypertensive urgency.
 .
# Dyspnea/Hypoxemia:
The patient was admitted to the MICU given his respiratory
distress. The most likely cause was felt to be hypertension
precipitating diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary edema. There
was likely a significant component of volume-overload to this
presentation as blood pressure, respiratory status and oxygen
requirement decreased post-hemodialysis with removal of >3L
fluid. A CTA demonstrated ground glass opacities with possible
infectious etiology so he was initially covered with broad
spectrum antibiotics.  Blood cultures negative, urine legoinella
negative, and clinical status improved with fluid removal so
antibiotics stopped on day 2. The patient was weaned rapidly
from non-rebreather to room air post-dialysis, and did not
require supplemental oxygen for the remainder of his
hospitalization.
.
# Malignant Hypertension:
His blood pressure was acutely controlled on a nitroglycerin
drip with rapid transition to control on home medications and
removal of fluid with hemodialysis. Hydralazone was
discontinued, as it was felt that it could be contributing to
his complaints of fatigue and depression.  Lisinopril was
titrated up from 20 mg to 30 mg daily, and the remainder of his
antihypertensive medications were continued at home doses.
.
# ESRD:
The renal team was consulted on arrival and hemodialysis was
started on the day of admission with removal of 3.3L of fluid.
The next day 400ml were taken off and hemodialysis was stopped
early due to an episode of chest pain. His home medications were
continued. He received epogen and zemplar with HD.
.
# Type 1 Diabetes Uncontrolled with Complications:
Last A1c 7.5 in [**Month (only) 404**].  The patient was continued on his home
regimen of lantus 15 units daily, and humalog sliding scale.
.
# R-Arm Pain:
Thought to be possibly related to AV Graft as having elevated
venous pressures during session, and some clot retrieved at
start of session.  Did thrombose graft and had thrombectomy in
past month.   However, the pain was worse with movement and
could also be musculoskeletal.  The graft functioned well during
dialysis.
.
# Chest pain:
The patient described left sided chest pain that was worse with
inspiration and reproducible with palpation. EKG was unchanged.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled with normal CK and slightly elevated
but unchanged troponins. This was thought to be due to demand
related ischemia in the setting of ESRD. CTA on admission was
negative for pulmonary embolism.
.
# Failure to thrive/weight loss:
Felt most likely to be secondary to depression.  The option of
starting an SSRI was discussed with the patient, and he
declined.  He was also followed by social work during this
admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
32 year old male with history of DM1, ESRD on HD, HTN presented
to ED with 24 hours of abdominal pain and N/V and found to have
DKA. He was managed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with IV insulin and transitioned
to SQ insulin. He was discharged to home with good glucose
control on glargin insulin plus a humalog sliding scale.
.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis - Presented with DKA with anion gap and
hyperglycemia. Anion Gap 19 in ED. Patient recieved HD the day
of admission, so possibilty metaboloic acidosis was corrected
during HD session. Trigger for DKA unclear, however, infection
can not be ruled out given subjective chills. No steroid use.
Initially on an insulin drip. Weaned off with improvement in
anion gap. Blood and urine cultures were negative, and CXR was
not consistent with infection. Once he was tolerating POs, had
WNL blood sugars, and a normal anion gap he was discharged home
with close follow up.
.
# Hypertension - History of hypertension. Maintained on PO
medications as outpatient (Toprol XL, amlodipine, lisinopril).
BP's in 150's in ED, elevated on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. EKG with no
ischemic changes. Improved with home regimen.
.
# Metabolic Alkalosis - Likely mixed picture of metabolic
acidosis from DKA and metabolic alkalosis from renal HD
replacement of bicarb, however this is assumption in setting of
no HD records.  Improved with improved DKA and HD.
.
# ESRD - On dialysis T-Th-Sa. Recieved dialysis on [**7-22**] and in
the FIC on [**7-24**]. Will resume HD as an outpatient the day after
discharge.
.
# Diabetes - in DKA, see section above. Discharged on glargin 15
units QAM and a Humalog sliding scale (See DC paperwork).

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 33 yo M with DM Type I, ESRD on HD (T/Th/S),
HTN with multiple past admissions for DKA, who self-presented to
the ED on [**2145-11-19**] with recurrent nausea and vomiting. He had
been in his usual state of health until Thursday evening,
[**2145-11-18**], when he suddenly developed nausea and multiple
episodes of vomiting of a non-bloody, non-bilious emesis that
lasted throughout the night. He also experienced progressively
worsening abdominal pain, describing it as a ""fire"" diffusely
located within his abdomen that was accompanied by new onset
back pain. Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] reported that his presenting nausea and
vomiting feels distinct from those associated with his past
admissions for DKA in severity and acuity. He denied any fever
or chills at home, but did experience diffuse sweating. He
denied recent cough or dyspnea; denied any constipation,
diarrhea and change in bowel habits; denied dysuria and change
in his urination.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] initially denied any significant changes in his oral
intake prior to the onset of his symptoms, but upon further
discussion mentioned that his refrigerator had stopped working
in the middle of the week and he and his girlfriend had been
eating out for most of their meals. Additionally, on Thursday
evening he drank some juice that had been in the refrigerator
and stated that he believes his symptoms are likely due to
ingestion of juice ""that had something growing in it,""
particularly as he had his first episode of vomiting soon after
he drank the juice.
.
Over the course of the night, Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] felt too ill to check
his blood glucose level and administer his insulin. His symptoms
became progressively worse, without any relief the next morning.
He did not take his morning dosage of glargline or
anti-hypertensives, and instead self-presented to the ED.
.
Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 40896**] insulin regimen consists of glargine 15 units in
the morning with breakfast and lispro sliding scale injections.
He reported that his blood sugars have been under reasonable
control (~140s) over the past few days. His last HD prior to
presentation (on Thursday [**2145-11-18**]) had been uneventful. After
dialysis is blood glucose levels were in the 70s and he received
some [**Location (un) 2452**] juice. He denies experiencing any recent dizziness,
lightheadedness, or sensation that the room is spinning.
.
<I>Per MICU signout</I>: In the ED, initial VS T 100.8, BP
203/110, HR 112, RR 18, O2 100% RA. He was later febrile to
101.9 and was given 1 g vancomycin. His AST/ALT/AP were elevated
at 73/42/165 respectively. Finger stick blood glucose (FSBG) was
initially 712, with an AG of 25. He was given 10 units of
regular insulin IV after which FSBG decreased to 583. He was
then given another 10 units IV regular insulin followed by 10
units SC insulin. A R external jugular line was placed for
access. He received a total 2L IVF.
.
While in the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] was initially placed on insulin
gtt and later transitioned to glargine and lispro sliding scale
as his diet was advanced. His AG (25 at presentation) decreased
to 15. He was given oxycodone prn for pain and compazine for
nausea. His ALT and AP have decreased from their values at
presentation, yet were still elevated on [**11-20**] at 55 and 135
respectively. His AST normalized at 31. His LDH was elevated at
266.
.
Currently, on the floor the patient has no acute complaints. He
denies any nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain and reports
feeling ready to go home.
.
ROS:
(+) Per HPI as above.
(-) Per HPI as above, and denies recent weight loss or gain.
Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough,
shortness of breath. He denies any sick contacts or recent
travel.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
30-35 %) with global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 33 yo M with DM Type I, ESRD on HD (T/Th/S),
HTN with multiple past admissions for DKA, who self-presented to
the ED on [**2145-11-19**] with recurrent nausea and vomiting and FSBG
of 712.
.
# DKA: It is likely that Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] had a viral gastroenteritis
or episode of food poisoning, leading to his nausea and
vomiting, which in the absence of his regular insulin
administration, triggered DKA. Though he denied any diarrhea or
change in bowel habits, or subjective fever, Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**]
experienced diffuse sweats prior to his presentation and later
became febrile following admission suggesting that infection is
a likely precipant of DKA. He received vancomycin in the ED,
after which he was afebrile. His CXR did not demonstrate any
acute pulmonary process, and on physical exam, his AVF was
neither tender or erythematous making PNA and fistula infection
a less likely cause of his symptoms. KUB demonstrated no
evidence of an acute abdominal process. Urine culture
demonstrated <10,000 organisms/ml. Blood cultures were sent with
no growth to date.
.
At presentation, patient's AG was 25 in the setting of FSBG
>600. He was started initially on an insulin gtt at 7 U/h. FS
were checked q1h and fell from 700s into the 100s over several
hours. D5 1/2 NS was started, and insulin drip down-titrated to
[**1-9**] U/h. Electrolytes were checked every four hours, and gap
went from 25 on admission to 15, his baseline, during the first
hospital night.  His diet was advanced. Upon transfer to the
floor from the MICU, his AG was 15. However at discharge, his AG
was elevated to 17 with a BG of 108.  His fs's had improved with
increase of his lantus to 20 units.  The patient insisted on
discharge.  Prior to his discharge, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] diabetes consult
was called and recommended he keep his outpatient insulin dosing
after discharge.  He was instructed to make a follow-up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20502**], his [**Last Name (un) **] diabetologist.
.
# Systolic Heart Failure: During this admission, patient
obtained an ECHO notable for mild LVH with moderate dilation and
LVEF = 30-35 % with global hypokinesis and regional inferior
akinesis. Of note, his LVEF from prior ECHO in [**3-/2145**] was 52%.
He was switched from labetalol to carvedilol for known
improvement in morbidity and mortality. He was informed of this
new change in his cardiac function.  He was set-up with
outpatient cardiology follow-up for both his systolic heart
failure and hypertension.
.
# Hypertension: Patient was initially hypertensive in the
setting of not having taken any of his meds since yesterday
morning. Home doses of lisinopril amlodipine, and labetalol were
restarted.  His blood pressure has historically been difficult
to control and should be monitored closely as his labetalol was
changed to carvedilol in consideration of his heart failure.
.
# ESRD on HD: Patient was continued on dialysis schedule
(T/Th/S) via LUE fistula and maintained on his home dosage of
sevelamer during the course of his hospitalization. There was no
acute indication for HD on admission (although his potassium was
elevated, it improved with insulin administration).
.
# Transaminitis: Patient had elevated AST/ALT upon presentation
that is likely due to elevated glucose and triglycerides
secondary to DKA. With treatment of DKA, transaminases have
trended downwards and approached their baseline levels. No acute
intervention was required.
.
# Anemia: Patient's anemia is Likely secondary to ESRD. Has been
stable throughout his admission and required no acute
interventions.
.
# Code Status: FULL CODE.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] a 33-year-old man with type I diabetes mellitus,
ESRD on dialysis on the transplant list, and frequent admissions
(9 admissions in [**2145**]) for diabetic gastroparesis who presented
in the early morning with nausea and vomiting for five days.

His initial vitals in the emergency room were T 100.0, HR 100,
BP 191/103, RR 16, satting 100% on RA. Labs were notable for
white count of 4.5 with normal differential, hematocrit of 29.4
(from baseline mid to high 30s), and platelets of 259. Initial
electrolytes showed a sodium of 127, bicarb of 24, BUN of 47,
and creatinine of 11.2. Anion gap was 18. Blood acetone level
was ""moderate"" and urinalysis was not obtainable as patient was
not making urine. Patient was initially given 8 units of lispro
insulin, per his home sliding scale regimen. Due to difficult IV
access issues, he did not receive intravenous fluids initially.
However, after an EJ was placed, he was given 1L of normal
saline and an insulin drip started. He was treated also with
morphine 2 mg intravenously and Zofran 6 mg intravenously. Renal
was contact[**Name (NI) **] in the emergency room and recommended gentle IVF
resuscitation since patient is anuric at baseline; per renal,
patient may not need dialysis today. A repeat chemistry panel at
time of admission showed an anion gap narrowed to 17, with serum
glucose of 311 (down from 448). Per ED report, patient is
getting a slow insulin drip. Vitals at time of admission are T
98, HR 88, BP 150/85, RR 20, 100% on room air.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 40897**] for
nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. He was initially admitted
to the medical ICU with anion gap of 25. He was placed on
insulin drip at 7u/h with finger sticks q1h and later
transitioned to glargine and lispro sliding scale. Infectious
workup during that admission was negative. Notably, an
[**Date range (1) 461**] during that admission showed an EF of 30-35% with
global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis. He followed
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic about one week prior to
this and according to that note, there is plan for cardiac
catheterization and repeat [**Last Name (STitle) 461**].

Regarding DKA etiology, pt endorses taking his insulin Lantus
and SSI. Denies any localizing infectious etiology.

ROS: Currently, patient endorses abdominal pain [**8-17**] and back
pain that is increasing since being moved from ED. At home, had
poor PO intake since Thursday, and n/v for the past week with

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there is still
substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. However, no
evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute
focal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
33-year-old man with history of insulin dependent diabetes,
end-stage renal disease on dialysis, and frequent admissions for
gastroparesis, now presents with nausea and vomiting x5 days,
labs concerning for ketoacidosis.

1. DKA: Unclear precipitant without signs of cardiac ischemia
(given cardiac history) or infection. Pt reported compliance
with insulin. Gap was closed by admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and pt easily
transitioned to subQ Lantus and Humalog sliding scale at home
doses. Tolerated PO's without problems and [**Name (NI) **] stabilized in
100's before discharge. Vitals stable and pt symptomatically
improved by discharge.

Unable to make f/u appt with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] MD, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] however
he was contact[**Name (NI) **] and stated he'll help us make f/u with [**Name8 (MD) **]
NP or [**Name8 (MD) **] educator. Pt was also given phone number to
contact [**Name (NI) **] and stressed importance of medical f/u.

2. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain: Known history of
gastroparesis on gastric emptying study [**5-/2137**] vs sxs of DKA.
Had CTAP without contrast the month before admission that was
negative to explain symtpoms. No fevers, WBC count, or diarrhea
to suggest infectious etiology.  N/V/Pain resolved with
resolution of DKA.  Tolerating full diet upon d/c. No
prokinetics used while in the ICU.

3. End-stage renal disease on dialysis: Pt is [**Name (NI) **]/Thurs/Sat at
[**Location (un) **] in [**Location (un) **]. IVF's were repleted cautiously for DKA
given bordeline anuria. Received HD x1 while admitted.

4. Systolic congestive heart failure: Per recent cards note,
suspect non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and plan per consult this
month was to proceed with cardiac catheterization. Pt currently
on Carvedilol, Lisinopril, and Amlodipine. Per consult note, no
current apparent benefit to adding statin. Was given cautious
IVF's given low EF and ESRD/borderline anuria. EKG/CE's negative
for ACS.

5. Anemia: Baseline in the 30's but seen to be mid 20's this
admission, likely due to some element of hemodilution, end stage
renal disease, and iron study labs suggestive of ACD. Hemolysis
labs were negative.  Reticulocyte count <2.0. Guiac was
negative. Continue to trend CBC with EPO per renal recs. Was not
hemodynamically significant.

# Hypertension/volume overload: Patient is an ESRD patient who
had received HD the day prior to admission to CCU. On the day of
admission Patient was noted to have sBP >170s during cardiac
catheterization, most likely from volume overload. Patient also
did not take his morning Amlodipine dose. He was admitted to the
CCU where he was started on ultra-filtration with the removal of
2.5L of fluid. Hypertension treated with nitro drip which was
weaned off prior to discharge.

echo of 30-35% in [**2145-11-8**] during an admission for DKA,
down from baseline of 52%. He underwent elective right- and left
sided cardiac catheterization to workup his cardiomyopathy,
which did not show CAD but did show elevated pulmonary wedge
pressure of 42 and pulmonary pressure of 77/36, suggestive of
volume overload. Final catheterization report was pending at the
time of discharge. Please see OMR.

Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 33y/o gentleman with poorly controlled DM1
complicated by gastroparesis and h/o DKA in the past, ESRD on
HD, HTN and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%) who presented
to the ED with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting in the
setting of hyperglycemia.
.
He reports that his blood sugars have been reasonably controlled
this week (<160) but he also admits that he has not checked his
fingerstick at home since the day prior to admission.  Yesterday
he tool his standing Lantus 18U in the AM, and then a total of
20 units of sliding scale Humalog.  The last fingerstick he took
was 160.  He awoke this morning feeling ""sick to my stomach,""
with abdominal pain and he vomited a small amount of nonbloody
fluid.  He continued to have abdominal pain and vomited a few
more times so he came to the ED.
.
The pain is a diffuse, burning epigastric pain that is
associated with nausea and vomiting.  It is similar to his prior
episodes of gastroparesis and DKA.  No RUQ pain.  He denies any
fevers/chills. No cough/URI symptoms.  He still makes a small
amount of urine but has had no dysuria and no change in the
color of his urine.  No flank pain.  No erythema or redness from
his RUE AVF.  No skin rashes.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 99.4, HR 101, BP 123/73, RR
18, POx 100% RA.  He was vomiting and appeared volume depleted
on exam and had diffuse abdominal tenderness but no acute
abdomen.  Labs revealed glucose 673, anion gap 21, pH 7.39.
Potassium 5.2 so received no potassium.  He received regular
insulin 10U then was started on regular insulin drip at 7U/hr.
Received 1L/hr for 3 hours (total 3L before transfer to ICU) and
still remained tachycardic.  For abdomminal pain, received
Morphine 4mg IV; no imaging was obtained in the ED.  Was given
Zofran 8mg IV and Compazine 10mg IV.  Vital signs prior to
transfer were T 99.3, HR 104, BP 182/108, RR 18, POx 96% RA.
.
On the floor, he complains of abdominal pain but says it is a
[**5-17**] (compared to 17/10 on admission).  No nausea right now but
starts to feel nauseated if talking for a long time.  Very
thirsty and asking for ice chips.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI.  Also last week he felt short of breath outside
which resolved when he sat near an air conditioner.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 33 y/o gentleman with HTN and DM1 presenting
with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting in the setting of
hyperglycemia that are consistent with prior episodes of
gastroparesis and DKA.
.
#. Hyperglycemia/DKA: The patient presented in DKA with a blood
sugar of 673 and an AG of 21. The patient has a h/o questionable
med adherance and DKA.  He was palced on an insulin gtt and
electrolytes were followed. The patient improved with good FS
and his gap fell to 13.  Troponin elevated but without CK-MB
elevations; findings likely a result of ESRD.  EKG without
evidence of AMI.  On arrival in the MICU, the patient's FS was
215.  Drip was d/c'ed and started on ISS.  On AM of [**7-31**], the
patient was still with FS in the 200s and had reopened a gap to
17.  ISS was increased without change in the anion gap despite
normal blood sugars, this persistant gap was thought likely [**2-9**]
renal failure and accumulation of organic acids.  Patient has
had multiple admissions in the past year for similar complaints,
patient's primary physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Patient asked
specifically that we not get [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult as it costs him
$300 each admission and he will follow up as an outpatient.
.
#. Abdominal pain: On arrival the paient complained of
burning/fullness likely as a result of DKA, gastroparesis and
abdominal wall tenderness from vomiting. This is similar to the
pain he has had in the past in the setting of poorly controlled
blood sugars.  Associated with nausea.  The pain and nausea were
controlled with zofran, reglan, APAP and dilaudid.  Reports that
abd pain is greatly improved on AM of [**8-1**].  Patinet has a [**Company 191**]
narcotics contract that states he will not recieve more than [**2-11**]
mg Diluadid PO twice daily.
.
#. HTN: The patient has a h/o poorly controlled BP.  Home meds
currently include Carvedilol, Amlodipine and Lisinopril.  In the
MICU, the patient's pressures were initially elevated to the
200/110s range.  Received home meds and labetolol overnight with
good improvement.  On [**7-31**], BPs are controlled with home meds to
130s systolic.
.
#. ESRD: The patient has ESRD on HD.  Last HD was [**7-30**] he is a
on a TTS schedule.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr [**Known lastname 21822**],

You were admitted for abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting that we
felt was secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  We're unsure
why your sugars went so high.  To treat this, we started you on
insulin and fluids, and your sugars resolved over the course of
a couple of days.  Your nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain
also improved.  We did not make any changes to your medications
at time of discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
DC SUMMARIES:
Brief course: DM1 c/b gastroparesis, ESRD on HD, neuropathy, HTN
who is admitted with 2 days of nausea and vomiting and found to
have hyperglycemia and gap acidosis most likely due to DKA, gap
has closed glycemic control regained, abdominal pain resolved.
.
Active issues:
# DKA: The patient has a h/o of recurrent episodes of DKA and
presents now with similar Sx to prior admissions. Unknown
exacerbating factor although may be related to the patient's
chronic gastroparesis and his N/V over the past 2 days. Also
consider viral URI vs. PNA given the patient's recent productive
cough which has since resolved. The patient reports good
compliance with medications although has been non-compliant in
the past. Other forms of gap acidosis less likely as lactate is
normal and patient was dialyzed yesterday. Is 2 kilos below dry
weight on admission.  Pt had insulin gtt in MICU, with
subsequent hypoglycemia. AG closed. He was transitioned to SC
insulin with normalization of blood sugars.
- FS QID, diabetic diet
- ISS
- SW consult given concern for repeated episodes and medication
non-compliance
- [**Last Name (un) **] saw the patient and made minor adjustments to his
sliding scale, will follow him as an outpatient
.
# Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient was hypertensive on
arrival with BPs up to 200 systolic while here. Most likely
etiology is poor compliance/absorption of home medications given
recent N/V. Also started on a [**Last Name (un) 40899**] patch recently but does
not have on here which may lead to rebound HTN.  BP improved in
MICU and continued to have good pressure control on the floor.
- continue home anti-hypertensives amlodipine, carvedilol,
[**Last Name (un) 40899**], lisinopril, stable
.
#. Elevated troponin - Patient with troponin elevated to 0.27
(0.25 on repeat). Has been elevated to these levels on prior
admission in early [**2146-10-8**]. Most likely due to renal
failure and inability to clear trops. Less likely ACS as no
ischemic changes on ECG or active CP.
-baseline, no need to cycle enzymes
.
# End stage renal disease: renal failure [**2-9**] to DM. HD schedule
on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Sat. Last dialyzed today in MICU. Will have regular
dialysis tomorrow.
- continue HD per schedule
- appreciate renal recs
- continue home sevelamer and Nephrocaps.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 34 year old man with PMH of T1DM, diabetic
nephropathy, recurrent gastroparesis, and retinopathy presenting
with nausea and vomiting of sudden onset during HD at [**Hospital1 18**] this
morning. Pt began to feel nauseaous this morning during the car
ride to HD and vomited before the treatment began. While in HD,
Pt vomited and retched violently, which pulled the HD tubing out
of his AV fistula and led to an arterial bleed. This was
controlled with clamping and the patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
In the ED his initial VS were 98.6, 80, 238/117, 24, and 97%.
The patient reports nausea and vomiting over the last couple
days of abdominal pain he has a history of gastroparesis and
this feels similar to that.  He denied any fevers or abdominal
pain different from his previous episodes of gastroparesis.  He
did not have an elevated BS in ED, and his urine did not have
ketones.  He was given dilaudid, fluid, zofran and iv reglan to
help control his abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, but this
had little effect.  He was also given IV metoprolol since he
reported not being able to keep down his BP meds this morning.

He was sent back to the HD unit to finish his hemodialysis where
he had a BP in the 220's/120's.  Patient was given 2 inches of
nitro paste, 25 mg SL captopril.  He was also ordered for home
amlodipine and carvedilol, but he vomited these up.  BPs better
controlled to SBP 190s, but after a few minutes, rose back up to
220s.  Pt was continually somnolent, uncomfortable while on HD
unit.
.
Currently, the patient continues to be nauseous and is vomiting
green liquid.  He is complaining of abdominal pain and
requesting dilaudid.  He denies any chest pain, palpitations,
dyspnea, headache, visual changes, dizziness, somnolence.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
34 year old man with PMH of poorly controlled T1DM, diabetic
nephropathy, recurrent gastroparesis, and retinopathy presenting
with nausea and vomiting of sudden onset during HD treatment
accompanied by hypertension and abdominal pain.
.
#Nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain: Pt vomited multiple times
during his HD treatment and again in the ER. Infection felt to
be unlikely given that pt was afebrile w/o any localizing signs,
elevated WBC. Pt also does not have any ketones, ruling out DKA.
Most likely differential include gastroparesis vs uremia. Nausea
was controlled with zofran/ativan. WBCs trended without
elevation. Serial abdominal exams were benign. Pt also has
extreme abdominal pain from his gastroparesis with home regimen
of dilaudid for which he has a narcotics contract with his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 40902**] not ideal, since they are likely to be exacerbating
gastroparesis. Pain managed with pr tylenol, IV reglan.  Pt
complaints improved.  Pt also given pain clinic appt on
discharge.
.
#Hypertension: Pt has well-documented essential hypertension.
Patient has been hypertensive since he came to the hospital. His
BP has been ranging from 190-220 systolic over 100-120
diastolic. PO BP meds (carvedilol, nitropaste, and captopril)
have been ineffective in lowering his BP significantly during
HD. His normal BP is 160's-180's. 3L volume was removed in HD
the day of admission. It was felt that abdominal pain from n/v
was likely contributing to hypertension. Pt is allergic to
hydralazine. Sublingual captopril and Labetelol PRN was used
overnight to control BP to target of SBP 180s. Also, pain was
controlled with rectal tylenol, IV reglan.  Pt was eventually
restarted on all his home meds and SBP was in the 130-140s upon
discharge.  Minoxidil was considered however not started as BP
was well-controlled on current regimen.  Home Carvedilol was
changed to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] as that is the max dose.
.
#Diabetes: Pt's sugars were in the 200 range on day of
admission. Urine ketones negative so not in DKA. Normally his
sugars are in high 100's or 200's. Occasionally he's in the
100s. He recently saw [**Last Name (un) **] in [**9-19**] and they had continued his
lantus and SSI regimen. He's currently taking lantus 18 units in
the morning at home. They increased it from 15 over the last few
months. He's also using a humalog sliding scale at home. Pt was
maintained on home regimen with sliding scale during this
admission, [**Last Name (un) **] was following. Pt was given [**Last Name (un) **] f/u appt on
discharge.
.
#Elevated troponins: Patient with troponin elevated to 0.16. Has
been elevated to these levels on multiple prior admissions. Most
likely due to renal failure and inability to clear trops. Less
likely ACS as no ischemic changes on ECG or active CP.  Enzymes
were not cycled as this level was his baseline.
.
#End stage renal disease: renal failure [**2-9**] to DM. HD schedule
on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Sat. Last dialyzed today with removal of 3L fluid.
Continued regular dialysis as scheduled.  Home sevelamer and
Nephrocaps were cotninued.
.
#Depression: Pt has a h/o depression and passive SI.  SW was
consulted.  Home meds were continued.

Imaging:

CXR [**2-24**]:
Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema.

CXR [**2-24**]:
Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the mid
superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Other
indwelling devices
remain in standard position. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
has slightly decreased in size, and widespread pulmonary edema
has also slightly improved in the interval. Small pleural
effusions have apparently slightly decreased in size but
positional differences limit comparison.

CXR [**2-27**]:
1. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip
in the mid SVC. There is worsening bilateral airspace process
most likely representing moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. The
heart is enlarged, which could reflect cardiomegaly, although
pericardial effusion should also be considered. This is likely a
layering left effusion. No pneumothorax is seen.

CXR [**2-28**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a marked
improvement with decrease in extent of the pre-existing massive
pulmonary edema. The radiograph currently shows only mild signs
of fluid overload.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without
pleural effusions. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged
right internal jugular vein catheter.

ECHO [**2-28**]:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity
enlargement and normal regional/global systolic function.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-2-10**], the
left ventricular cavity is now smaller and systolic function is
improved. The estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
34 yo M PMHx DM1, ESRD (on HD [**Year (4 digits) **]/Thurs/Sat), severe
gastroparesis with recurrent admissions for nausea/vomitting
(most recent discharge [**2147-2-17**]), nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF previously 30-35%), presenting with nausea, vomiting,
admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.

# Respiratory failure: Likely due to pulmonary edema in the
setting of CHF exacerbation. Intubated in the ED due to
worsening mental status.  Extubated on [**1-25**], and able to
saturate well on room air.  On the floor he was initially on
room air.  However, on [**2-27**], patient became tachypneic and
desatted into the 70-80s in the setting of severe HTN to
220/120s.  Exam and CXR consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
Patient initially on NRB, received urgent dialysis (-3L) and was
able to be weaned to nasal cannula, he did not require
intubation.  His BP was controlled as below and he was
transferred back to the floor where he remained on room air
until discharge.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Likely caused by
severe HTN, with HTN possibly exacerbated by vomiting. Has
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy for EF which was previously reported
as 30-35%.  MI ruled out with serial enzymes. He received extra
sessions of hemodyalysis to remove volume, although these were
often stopped early because he reported chest pain.  A repeat
echo showed an improved EF of 55% during this admission.

# Alveolar hemorrhage - Bronchoscopy was performed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
which was concerning for alveolar hemorrhage.  This was
performed because of blood in his endotracheal secretions.  The
cause was likely severe hypertension. Serologies were sent for
[**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and anti-GBM, all of which were negative.  He had no
further obvious episodes of hemorrhage and had no hemoptysis
after leaving the floor.

# Hypertension: Patient has severe HTN, on multiple meds in
setting of underlying ESRD. He was initially continued on home
doses of [**Doctor First Name 40899**], carvedilol, lisinopril, amlodipine.  On the
floor, he remianed hypertensive and his [**Doctor First Name 40899**] patch was
increased to 0.3mg/24h.  On [**2-27**], developed BP into 220/120s
with flash pulmonary edema.  He was transferred to the ICU and
started on nitro drip and also received IV labetalol to lower
his BP.  HTN thought to be related to fluid overload, he
improved with an extra session of HD which removed 3L by
ultrafultration.  Patient has been recently skipping HD sessions
and sometimes HD cut short due to crampy chest pain.  His
carvedilol was changed to labetalol to allow for more room to
uptitrate.  At discharge, he was on labetalol 300mg q8h with BP
in the 160s.  We wanted to monitor his BP for another 24 hours
after this medication change but the patient insisted on leaving
AMA, as described below.

# Anemia:  Chronic anemia related to ESRD.  Transfused one unit
during hospitalization.  No source of acute bleed was identified
aside from mild degree of pulmonary hemorrhage, as discussed
below.

# ESRD on HD (TuThSa): Renal was consulted and he continued to
receive HD as an inpatient. Continued on sevelamer and
nephrocaps.  Had urgent dialysis on [**2-27**] for hypertensive
emergency and pulmonary edema as described above.

# DM1: Initially presented with severe hyperglycemia.  Developed
hypoglycemia on insulin gtt requiring D20 to maintain
normoglycemia.  After initial transfer to the floor, he remained
hyperglycemic with multiple ""critical high"" blood sugars
requiring additional doses of Lantus.  At the time of his second
MICU stay, he was again hyperglycemic to the 400s.  Anion gap
~16-17, but also with ESRD.  PH 7.45 on ABG.  Does not make
urine, so cannot measure urine ketone.  No clear evidence of
DKA.  Patient restarted on insulin drip and transitioned to
subcutaneous insulin once tolerating PO.  Josline was consulted
and his Lantus dose was increased to 14 units qAM and 12 units
qPM.  Again, we had hoped to monitor his glucose for longer
after the most recent uptitration of his insulin, however he
left AMA.

#AMA: On [**3-2**], the patient was still mildly hypertensive to the
160s systolic and his labetalol had just been uptutrated.  We
had also recently increased his Lantus dose.  We wanted to
monitor him longer to ensure adequate BP and glycemic control
after these medication changes.  However, the patient was very
frustrated with being in the hospital and chose to leave AMA.
He understood and was able to repeat the risks of leaving,
including worsening hypertension, fluid accumulation in the
lungs, hyperglycemia and DKA and possible death.

# Code status this admission: FULL CODE

#Transitional issues
-Will need BP closely monitored, antiypertensive regimen
changed: carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] changed to labetalol 300mg q8h
-Will need close monitoring of his blood sugar with uptitration
of his Lantus this admission
-Dry weight should be re-evaluated so that an appropriate amount
of fluid is removed with each HD session
-Would likely benefit from outpatient social work given that he
is very frustrated and depressed about the state of his health,
which may be contributing to his poor compliance.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to
[**Hospital1 18**].  You were initially admitted to the intensive care unit
where you were intubated for respiratory failure, thought to be
due to an exacerbation of heart failure.  You had fluid removed
with dialysis and your symptoms improved.  After transfer to the
medicine floor, your blood pressure was severely elevated and
fluid built up in your lungs, for which you were readmitted to
the ICU.  There, you received IV medications to lower your blood
pressure and an insulin drip to control your blood sugar.  Your
blood pressure and blood sugar improved and were again
transferred to the medicine floor.

We stopped your carvedilol and added labetalol to help control
your blood pressure.  We also increased your [**Hospital1 40899**] patch to
0.3mg/24h.  Labetalol was increased to 300mg every 8 hours.  We
wanted to watch your blood pressure after the most recent change
to your medications, but you wanted to leave against medical
advice.  Please check your BP at home and call your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **], or return to the hospital if it is higher than 180/100 or
if you have any headache, changes in vision, chest pain or
shortness of breath.

It is important that you go to each session of dialysis to
remove fluid and help control your blood pressure.  You will
follow up with your nephrologist after discharge at your next
dialysis session.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

The following changes were made to your medications:
START labetalol 300mg by mouth three times per day
STOP carvedilol
CHANGE [**Name8 (MD) 40899**] patch 0.3mg/24h change every [**Name8 (MD) 766**]
CHANGE Lantus 14 units in the morning and 12 in the evening

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
34 year-old man with hx brittle DM1 c/b HD-dependent ESRD now
admitted with sympomatic early-monrning hypoglycemia, BS 15.
.
Patient reports taking usual dose of lantus (10 units) at 11pm
on the night prior to admission and then he next remembers being
put in an ambulance.  His girlfriend gave him glucose tablets
and called 911 because he he was ""talking funny"" and seemed
confused early that morning. He doesn't remember any of this.
EMS found the patient unresponsive with a FS of 15 - glucagon
and IV dextrose were administered.
.
In the ED the patient was hypertensive but otherwise had stable
VS. Initial FS was 179 & on repeat fell to 44. He was started on
D10W gtt. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted in the ED and the patient was
admitted to the MICU for BS monitoring. Pt reports that he had
been taking his current insulin regimen for ~1 months without
hypoglycemia. Describes normal PO intake on the day prior to
admission (eats several small meals throughout the day to
prevent gastroparesis), perhaps less protein than usual. Denied
alcohol or drug use. No unusual exercise.
.
  Of note, the patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 1396**] for
CHF exacerbation that was notable for flash pulm edema due to
hypertension & required intubation for worsening mental status.
Patient also briefly required nitro drip and IV labetalol as
well as dialysis for blood pressure control. On that admission,
a bronchoscopy was concerning for alveolar hemorrhage, but [**Doctor First Name **],
ANCA and anti-GBM were negative and patient had no further
episodes of bleeding. Repeat echo on that admission showed an
improved EF of 55%. That hospital course was c/b initial
hyperglycemia then subsequent hypoglycemia requiring D20 gtt. On
the floor the patient was again hyperglycemic requiring high
doses of insulin prompting transfer bact to the MICU for insulin
gtt. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted on that admission and recommended
increasing Lantus dose to 14units qAM and 12 units qPM. Patient
ultimately signed out AMA on [**3-2**].

Past Medical History:
- DM type I since age 19, followed at [**Last Name (un) **]. Complicated by
nephropathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis, retinopathy. Multiple
prior hospitalizations with DKA, nausea/vomiting [**2-9**]

Social History:
Lives with girlfriend. Mother also local.
College degree in marketing, worked at [**Company 2475**] previously.
Tobacco: trying to quit; relapsed and smokes ~1 pack per week
EtOH: previously drank heavily (30-40 drinks/week) but has not

Brief Hospital Course:
34M w/hx type 1 diabetes mellitus c/b gastroparesis,
HD-dependent ESRD and chronic systolic heart failure (with
recent documented recovery of EF)  brought to the ED by EMS
after being found confused at home with a BS 15. Hospital course
was notable for hypo and hyperglycemia. Patient left AMA prior
to insulin regimen stabilization.
.
#SYMPTOMATIC HYPOGLYCEMIA/Diabetes mellitus type 1:
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU where he was
monitored and given D10 until blood sugars consistently above
100 (137-295).  Pt reported no change in diet, alcohol
consumption or exercise to explain different response to usual
insulin dose. Pt history and OMR notes suggested long history of
difficulties controlling labile BS and admission for both hypo
and hyperglycemia. He was followed closely by the [**Last Name (un) **] consult
service in house, who recommended 8U lantus [**Hospital1 **] + humalog
sliding scale. This plan was applied for ~36h with no marked
change in lability of QACHS BS which ranged from 23 to >500.
Plan was for pt to stay inpatient for further insulin dose
adjustment, but pt decided to leave AMA prior to any further
changes. In addition, because pt was very uncomfortable using
*any* qHS lantus at home given his recent hypoglycemic episode,
[**Last Name (un) **] consult adjusted their regimen to 14U lantus qAM +
humalog sliding scale. Risks of leaving the hospital prior to
insulin regimen stabilization were discussed with the patient,
who understood. He was given a printout of final insulin scale
prior to leaving the hospital. Will need close outpatient
follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] diabetologist and PCP.
.
# [**Name (NI) 40903**] ESRD
Pt's HD schedule is T/Th/S via right arm fistula (dry weight
73kg). Euvolemic on admission, underwent HD on [**4-8**]. All meds
were dosed renally.

# HTN
Hypertensive in MICU on admission. Home [**Month/Day (4) 40899**] patch,
labetalol, lisinopril, amlodipine were restarted.

# CARDIOMYOPATHY, CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE EF 30-35%
Secondary to long-standing and poorly controlled hypertension.
Euvolemic on admission. Currently asymptomatic, without dyspnea,
hypoxia or exam evidence of volume overload. Continued on ASA
and Labetalol.
.
# HX DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS
On PRN zofran and dilaudid at home. No symptoms during this
admission. Ate regular meals.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**],

You were admitted to the hospital for blood sugar of 15. You
stayed overnight in the ICU for blood sugar monitoring. Your
blood sugars were very labile - ranging from the 70s to 500s.
Last night your blood sugar dropped from >500 to 29 over 5 hours
because of ""insulin stacking"" - taking too much insulin over a
few hours.

Because your blood sugars are so unstable, we recommended
staying in the hospital for further insulin dosing modification
and observation.
You are leaving against medical advice.
The attending physician discussed [**Name9 (PRE) 40904**] risks of high
and low blood sugars with you, including confusion, lethargy,
fainting and coma. You were aware of these risks and decided to
leave anyway.

We spoke with the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes doctors before [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **].

urgency.

# DKA- DM1 since age 19. History of uncontrolled blood glucose,
also with gastroparesis and frequent N/V. Bglc on transfer to
MICU 246. Anion gap = 29 on arrival to ED.
**ICU Course: the patient presented initially with
hyperglycemia, but no initial gas to confirm acidosis, this was
treated in the ED and blood sugars had normalized and the gap
had closed appreciably, he was initially on an insulin drip
which was discontinued the next morning when he began taking
POs; he had labile blood sugars on HD2 likely due to nausea
after his glargine dose and then attempting to correct for the
resulting hypoglycemia.  He had normalized by the morning of HD3
and was tolerating a regular diet and blood sugars were well
controlled.  He never needed to go back on the drip.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and was following the patient.
**Floor course: Pt had labile sugars while on the floor, ranging
from 60-300s. His insulin regimen was titrated. Patient left

admissions for hypertensive urgency/emergency. Unclear etiology
of labile BP. On home regimen of lisinopril, amlodipine, patch.
Currently hypertension is under control, will resume home
medication regimen.
**ICU Course: the patient received 20mg of IV labetalol in the
emergency department which improved his pressures, but
subsequently became hypertensive again and a nitroglycerine drip
was initiated in the MICU- the patient remained on this drip
through most of HD2 has he was still nauseous and would not
tolerate his PO antihypertensives.  The drip was discontinued on
HD3 and the patient took his home medications.  He never had any
neuro changes, and his renal function was baseline and he was
dialyzed regardless.

Syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who presented
to the ED overnight with nausea, vomiting, and inability to
tolerate pos. Per ED report, he stated he had been non-compliant
with insulin for ""months"" and was complaining of fatigue,
malaise, low grade headaches, and episodes of nausea and
vomiting on the day of admission. Per report, patient was noted
to say ""I know I am in DKA now."" He had not taken any insulin
since Saturday. He denied abdominal or chest pain, shortness of
breath, fevers, or chills. No difficulty or pain with urinating.

His initial vitals in the ED were T 97.8, HR 128, BP 142/99, RR
18, satting 97% RA. CBC showed a white count of 14.5 with 84%
polys, no bands, hematocrit of 46.9 (from baseline low 40s), and
platelets of 237. Electrolytes were notable for potassium of
3.8, bicarb of 8 (from baseline 30), anion gap of 35, and
BUN/creatinine of 22/1.9 (from baseline ~25/1.3). Urine ketones
were positive. Patient was given 2L normal saline followed by 1L
D5 [**2-14**] with 40 mEq KCl. He was started on an insulin drip
without bolus. A repeat set of labs, prior to admission, shwoed
sodium of 140, potassium of 4.3, chloride of 100, bicarb of 10
and glucose of 345. Vitals at time of transfer were HR 110, BP
121/69, RR 18, sat 100% RA. For access patient currently has
[**3-4**] gauge IV.

Currently, patient says that he feels better than this morning.
He denies nausea, abdominal pain, chest pain, cough, shortness
of breath, or pain with urination.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE

40-year-old man with history of Gitelman's Syndrome and [**Doctor Last Name **]
presents with diabetic ketoacidosis.

# Diabetic ketoacidosis: pt reported not taking his insulin
since the Saturday prior to admission.  Denied any viral
prdoromes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  No focal consolidations
on CXR.  No fevers, chills.  No chest pain.  CE negative x2.
Presented with AG metabolic acidosis with HCO3 of 8 and AG of
39.  Received insulin and bolus resuscitation in the ED.
Hypomagnesemic, hypophosphatemic, and relatively hypokalemic on
presentation.  Insulin gtt started at 8 U an hour with fluid
rescusitation initially with NS+40 meq potassium.  ABG attempted
multiple times but could not be processed [**3-17**] clotting.  BG
continued to downtrend from baseline >450 to 200's within [**3-18**]
hours of presentation.  Patient began to clinically deteriorate,
with difficulty breathing, nausea/vomiting, profound weakness,
and lethargy over the first few hours of ICU presentation.
Laboratory data revelaed profund hypophophatemia at 0.7.
Immediate po repletion attempted but patient could not tolerate
PO secondary to vomiting.  Also hypomagnesmic at 0.8.
Aggressive resuscitation with Potassium Phosphate, magnesium
sulfate, with running insulin gtt was performed.  Patient's
symptoms stabalized and was able to tolerate PO by 7AM.
Magnesium and Phosphate levels corrected to 1.7 and >2.0
respectively.  AG closed by 7 AM.  BG's steady in the 150-200
range.  Potassium repletion continued with levels >3.5.
Stopped insulin drip and restarted home Lantus when anion-gap
narrowed to <12 and bicarb >18 with overlap of [**2-14**] hours. [**Last Name (un) **]
consulted instructing to continue home insulin dosing at 26U
glargine in the AM with SSI.  Patient tolerating PO's by ICU day
2.  He was transferred out to the floor for ongoing care,
however he remained hyperglycemic into high 300's despite
ongoing insulin titration with [**Last Name (un) **].  Patient subsequently
eloped, and refused ongoing inpatient care. He refused to wait
for discharge instructions or prescriptions.

# Atypical RML finding on CXR: so incidental increased
radioopacity around RML on CXR.  Radiology requested oblique
film for better analsysis. Radiology recommended repeat
radiograph in [**2-14**] months to assess for interval change.

# Leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance: Worked up for
possible infection.  No source was found.  Most likely due to
increased sympathetic tone and increased cortisol in setting of
hypoglycemia.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: thought to be prerenal
azotemia in the setting of volume depletion from glucosuria and
osmotic diuresis.  Also, given ketoacidosis, falsely elevates
Cr.  Resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation.

# Gitelman's syndrome: most recent outpatient nephrology note
mentions maintaining diet high in potassium. Patient confirms
that he tries to eat fruits high in potassium to maintain normal
potassium levels. No other clear interventions at this time.
Close monitoring of potassium as above, with aggressive
repleteion during DKA.  Stable during ICU stay.  Pt's potassium
was repleted as able, however due to his Gitelman's only
modestly improved.  Pt was not interested in electrolyte
repletion.

# Chronic diabetic neuropathy: continued home gabapentin,
oxycodone, and baclofen

# Emergency contact: wife [**Name (NI) 382**].
# Code status: full code.
DISP: Pt eloped from the medical floor, despite ongoing insulin
titration and severe hyperglycemia. Pt was addressed in the
elevator, encouraging him to stay for ongoing care, however pt
refused and left against medical advise. Pt acknowledged the
risk with leaving AMA, including, but not limited to
redevelopment of DKA and possible death.

Medications on Admission:
- baclofen 20 mg twice daily

used to smoke many years ago, but quit over 30 years ago and she
is disabled.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Admission PE: Motor is full throughout. Sensory is slightly
better on the left
compared to the right. Reflexes are 2+ symmetric. No abnormal
reflexes. No tenderness on palpation of the neck, but she does
have pain on rotation.

At Discharge: She has a cervical collar with staples at the
posterior cervical spine. She has bilateral LE amputations. She
has UE peripheral neuropathy.


Pertinent Results:
MRI of her cervical spine was reviewed.
Significant for severe DJD of the cervical spine and cord
compression due to disc herniation and ligamentous hypertrophy
at
C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7.

CHEST [**2104-3-11**]
A semierect portable AP view of the chest was obtained. The
heart
is moderately enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular congestion
and severe
pulmonary interstitial edema. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions and a retrocardiac opacity likely representing
atelectasis. There is no
pneumothorax. Surgical clips overlie the mediastinum and
orthopedic hardware is noted within the cervical spine. No
osseous abnormalities are identified.

CHEST [**2104-3-16**]
Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement
suggests cardiac
decompensation, but there has been improvement since [**3-11**]
and there is no pulmonary edema. I see no consolidation to
indicate atelectasis or
pneumonia and no pleural effusion. Left subclavian line ends in
the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.

Shoulder X-ray [**2104-3-11**]
No fracture or dislocation. Probable calcific
tendinitis/bursitis.

ECHO [**2104-3-12**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved global
systolic function (LVEF>50%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with borderline
normal free wall function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 year old female with multiple medical issues
presents for elective posterior cervical laminectomy and fusion.
She went to the OR on [**3-10**]. The surgery  was uncomplicated and
she was transferred to the PACU for recovery. Medicine was
consulted for management of multiple medical pathologies. She
was scheduled to go to dialysis and renal was consulted to see
patient. On post op exam, patient was full strength except for L
deltoid [**3-29**], limited by pain. On [**3-11**], patient's exam remains
unchanged. She was observed to be 88% O2 sat on 5L NC. A CXR was
ordered and she was sent to dialysis. CXR showed atelectasis,
mild bilateral pleural effusions, and a moderately large
silhoute of the heart. Her lung sounds improved on [**3-12**].
Medicine asked to stop her clonidine. She was screened for rehab
per PT. Her shoulder X-ray final report mentions tenditnitis and
bursitis. Ice was ordered.

She was transported to dialysis on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 in the early morning
of [**3-13**]. The patient reported diffuse abdminal pain and
tenderness while on dialysis. She was seen by the renal fellow
who sent a lactic acid which was 0.9 and requested a KUB as she
was constipated with signs of an incarcerated ventral hernia.
This imaging was ordered stat and her dialysis was aborted with
about 1 hour remaining. This was cleared by the renal fellow.
The ACS service was contact[**Name (NI) **] to eval for possible surgery. By
hospital protocol this was then referred to the transplant team
due to her end stage renal disease. She was taken to the OR with
instructions by the Neurosurgery team that her collar should
remain in place at all times.

On [**2104-3-13**] she underwent exploratory laparotomy, colectomy,
ileostomy and repair of recurrent ventral hernia. See Dr [**Name (NI) 41400**] operative note of the same date for details.
Post-operatively, she was taken to the ICU intubated. She was
extubated the following morning (POD4/1) without difficulty and
was oxygenating well on a 50% mask. She remained in the ICU for
several days because of her high oxygen demand, then was
transferred to the floor on POD7/4. Her diet was sequentially
advanced while monitoring her ostomy for production. By POD [**8-29**]
(HD9), she was tolerating a regular diet with minimal oxygen
requirement. Her ostomy was functioning well with 0.5L output
per day. Throughout her hospitalization, she continued
hemodialysis using her left radiocephalic AVF, taking off
approximately 3L ultrafiltrate per session.

On the day of discharge, she was tolerating regular diet with
pain well controlled on [**2-28**] oxycodone per day. Her neck incision
staples were removed by neurosurgery. Her abdominal laparotomy
incision was clean, dry and intact with staples in place. She
was provided with instructions for follow-up and was given
instructions for her care facility.
