Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization  [**2200-3-7**]
[**2200-3-11**] CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to DIAG)


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 year old male with CAD s/p MI with DES to
LAD in [**2196**] c/b ISRS in [**2196**] (re-stent) and [**4-/2199**] (BMS x3) and
DES to proximal LAD in [**9-/2199**], rapid atrial tachycardia s/p
AVNRT ablation, DM2, ESRD on HD (last done yesterday), and PVD
s/p partial left foot amputation.  He reports that he developed
a productive cough on [**2200-3-3**].  He did not have any fevers or
chills.  Later that night, he developed substernal chest pain
and pressure like ""an elbow pressing in the chest"" up to [**6-17**] in
intensity.  He denied any associated dyspnea, nausea, vomiting,
or diaphoresis.  The pain resolved with SLNG, but recurred the
next morning shortly before his PCA arrived.  He has had anginal
chest pain in the past with a similar quality, but not as
severe.  He continued to have chest pain, and was brought to the
[**Hospital3 417**] ED.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] on [**2200-3-4**], where he was found
to have hyperkalemia and Troponin elevation with peak 43.71.
His CXR reportedly showed ""mild congestion.""  He was started on
a Heparin drip.  His pain resolved and he had no further
complaints of chest pain, but did have dyspnea getting up to the
commode.  He was transferred here today for cardiac
catheterization.  Vital signs prior to transfer were T 98.9, HR
68 (SR with LBBB), BP 117/62, RR 22, and SpO2 98% on RA.  At the
OSH, he was also noted to be intermittently incontinent of
stool.
.
Cardiac catheterization today was attempted with a right radial
approach, but was unsuccessful, and was converted to a right
femoral approach.  The cath showed 3VD and no intervention was
performed.  He is now being evaluated for possible CABG.  On
arrival to the floor, he was CP free and reported no pain or
tenderness at the cath site.  He continued to have a somewhat
productive cough.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, significant
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.  He does
report DOE, and is able to walk less than 150 ft and climb less
than one flight of stairs before becoming SOB at baseline.
.
On further review of systems, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He has had a clot
removed from his dialysis fistula in the past.  He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF=25-30 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque . There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function ( EF = 30-35%)
2. Mitral regurgitation is moderate now
3. Unchanged tricuspid regurgitation
4. Intact aorta

Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation
Radial arterial line insertion

History of Present Illness:
58y/o RHM with history of liver transplant, Hepatitis C, chronic
renal disease and multiple asymptomatic strokes, presented with
sudden decline in his mental status. His wife witnessed him be
struggling get out from bed, decline in his
awareness. His wife spoke to him with appropriate condition
around 6:05PM. Around 6:25PM, she heard that the patient started
to say non-sence, act inappropriately, unable to exchange
conversation. His wife recalled some ""shaking"" at the right arm.
He was brought into [**Hospital1 18**] ED above time and Neurology was
consulted for code stroke.

In ED, while Neurology was examining patient, he developed right
arm, leg clonic seizure with head deviation and gaze deviation
toward to left. He responded with moan when his name was called,
then developed left arm clonic seizure (secondary
generalization) and became unresponsive. Ativan 2mg IV was given
to stop. Patient was intubated subsequently to have further
neuroradiological evaluation.

HPI ADDENDUM:
Further history was obtained from the patient's wife the morning
following his admission. She reports the patient was well until
returning from a same-day-surgical procedure on [**10-14**] for repair
of left eye retinal detachment. The patient was vague with his
reported symptoms, but complained of ""feeling lousy"" with poor
appetite and fatigue. He did not eat or drink very much Friday
or Saturday following. On Saturday evening he began to vomit
quite frequently. They had a small breakfast Sunday morning and
the patient was still feeling unwell, but altogether normal per
his wife. She left for a few hours during the day, returned home
and heard him yelling out of frustration after having dropped
something in his room, however the yelling continued and she
went to see him and noted that he had a great amount of
difficulty getting himself upright to the edge of his bed. She
then noted his right arm was shaking. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where the above described event occurred.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2809**] is a 58 year old gentleman s/p liver transplant
related to chronic HCV infection, myopathy (? steroid induced),
history of prior multiple asymptomatic embolic infarcts prior to
transplantation, who presents with three day prodrome of general
malaise, poor appetite, nausea/vomiting, followed by acute
change in mental status with witnessed partial complex seizure
in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

1) Neuro:
* SEIZURE - Initially a code stroke was called in the ED, but CT
imaging and later, MRI, showed no evidence of acute infarction.
Initial labs notable for presence of only serum benzodiazepines
on tox screening and acute on chronic renal failure. Etiology of
seizure was thought to be areas of prior cortical infarcts in
setting of gastrointestinal illness. The patient was intubated
in the emergency department and promptly extubated at 2am in the
Neuro ICU the same evening. The morning following admission the
patient's examination was notable for marked encephalopathy. He
was changed from phenytoin to oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) given
multiple long term side effects of phenytoin, and with normal
hepatic function, but renal impairment and keppra did not seem a
wise choice. Lumbar puncture was attempted with light sedation
without success. It was re-attempted with fentanyl and midazolam
for monitored conscious sedation and revealed 1 WBC, 0 RBC,
normal protein and glucose. He was transferred to the floor
after an EEG done on the [**7-18**] revealed no
abnormalities and showed a normal background.
* ENCEPHALOPATHY - On the floor, the patient's exam was notable
for continued encephalopathy, but he was evidently not
delerious. His main abnormalities were frontal dysfunction (as
exhibited by impulsiveness, stimulus-bound behaviors,
desinhibition, bilateral grasp and palmomental reflexes, a
marked inability to switch mindset) and memory (as exhibited by
anososgnosia, orientation to place and time, as well as not
imprinting new information, and working memory (the patient
stayed in-task, and had sufficent attention to perform, but
couldn't complete the tasks). Clinically he continued to improve
slowly but surely, an EEG done on [**10-21**] showed 7 Hz background,
but otherwise normal. Per his wife, his level of cognitive
functioning at home was high, as for example he was able to
discuss politics.

2) Cardio:
* NSTEMI - Patient was noted to have elevated troponin enzymes
to 0.31 with EKG without ischemic changes. He was started on
aspirin, beta blocker, atorvastatin. Cardiology consultation was
obtained and additionally recommended echocardiogram which
revealed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, no
focal wall motion abnormalities (poor data quality though),
LVEF>55%, mild aortic valve stenosis. His NSTEMI was thought
related to demand related ischemia in the setting of
catecholamine surge associated with seizure. He should be
scheduled for an exercise stress test as an outpatient.

3) FEN
* Acute Renal Failure - Patient's has prior hepato-renal
syndrome now with baseline creatinine of 1.9-2. Admission
creatinine notable for 2.4. He was noted to have low urine
output. He received vigorous IV hydration with improved Cr to
1.6, however this was likely a sampling error because all the
lines of his cellcount were down on this blooddraw as well,
repeat labs showed a creat of 2.0 and his [**Hospital1 **] back to the old
values. His medications were renally dosed. He was started on
Thiamine, Folate and MVI.

4) Liver transplantation
Transaminase levels on admission were WNL. Hepatology
consultation was obtained and recommended continuing with his
prior regimen of immunosuppressive agents. No changes were made.


5) ID
A broad spectrum of CSF studies were sent despite the normal
cell count. Varicella PCR and CMV PCR negative, remainder
pending. MRSA isolation negative. VRE swab negative.
Cryptococcal antigen GRAM STAIN, FLUID CULTURE, FUNGAL
CULTURE-PRELIMINARY,ACID FAST CULTURE, VIRAL CULTURE were all
(preliminary) negative.

Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with a PMH s/f type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with
prior episodes of DKA in the past, complicated by and NSTEMI in
[**8-/2111**], biventricular CHF, severe PVD s/p recent femoral bypass
for an ischemic right foot, and current cocaine abuse.  Last
night, her father noted her to have a decreased appetite, and
""changes in her body language"" consistent with past
presentations of hyperglycemia.  She went to sleep and woke up
at 3AM with extreme hunger.  At that time he checked a finger
stick, and noted it to be critically high.  He spoke to the
[**Last Name (un) **] coverage, who recommended administering her 75/25 and
sliding scale, and to continue monitoring.  When her finger
sticks and mental status did not change, he brought her to the
ED.  She has not had any fevers, chills, night sweats, URI
symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Her parents note severe pain
in both of her legs, which is chronic ""phantom limb pain"" and
neuropathy.  She had a dry cough this morning, but this is
chronic.
.
On arrival to the ED she was afebrile, hypotensive with an SBP
of 88, HR=86, RR=18, O2 sat 100%.  She was A+Ox2, and complained
of left knee (phantom) pain.  Her exam was notable for dry
gangrene on her right foot.  Labs showed a blood sugar of 744, a
bicarbonate of 8, an anion gap of 30, ABG 7.12/30/106/10.  She
was given a 7 unit bolus of insulin, followed by 7units/hour
infusion, and a 2L NS bolus.  Labs were otherwise notable for a
creatinine of 3.5 (from a baseline of 1), flat cardiac enzymes,
leukocytosis to 19.8, thrombocytosis to 714, tox screen positive
for cocaine, and a contaminated UA.  CXR was clear, EKG is not
done, CT head pending, blood and urine cultures were sent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right
femoral bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered
mental status secondary to DKA.

#. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The etiology of the patient's DKA was
thought to be medication noncompliance in the setting of
polysubstance abuse, as her tox screen was positive for cocaine
and she had no evidence of acute infection or cardiac ischemia.
A UA and CXR were nonfocal.  She was aggressively rehydrated
with normal saline, receiving approximately 6L in the ED and
overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Her respiratory status was followed
closely, given her history of bisystolic dysfunction.  She was
also initially managed with an insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr
(0.1units/kg/hr) until her blood sugar fell below 250 and her
anion gap closed, at which point she was started on an ISS.  Her
anion gap did widen to 17 on hospital day #2, [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted, and she was transitioned back to insulin gtt
overnight.  Then with closed gap, she was transitioned back to
[**Hospital1 **] nph 18 and 24.  Her finger stick glucose, lytes, and pH were
monitored closely, and potassium was repleted prn throughout her
ICU course.  Patient was transferred to floor on [**Hospital1 **] sq insulin,
with glucoses <150, and stable vital signs.  On the floor she
had some episodes of hypoglycemia (BS 40s).  The patient did not
eat as much as she should at meals because ""I don't like the
food here.""  Patient was given juice and crackers and blood
sugar returned to the normal range.  Her Humalog 75/25 was
reduced to her home dose of 15units qam and 20units qpm.  She
was instructed to follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.
.
# Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration,
as evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.  Her Cr
improved to 1.7 after intravascular volume repletion.  She was
also continued on nephrocaps and her medications were renally
dosed.
.
#. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine,
prior OMR notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.  [**Name (NI) **]
home regimen of metoprolol was held given the risk of unopposed
alpha agonism in setting of beta blockade.
.
#. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction:  Monitored
closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia.  Her
BB and lisinopril were held in the setting of hypotension and
ARF, but restarted before [**Name (NI) **].
.
#. Chronic Pain: Her home regimen of oxycodone was held until
her mental status cleared.  It was resumed at [**Name (NI) **].
.
#. Anxiety/depression:  Concintued clonazepam and lorazapam once
mental status cleared.
.
# Peripheral vascular disease:  The pt is s/p left BKA.  THe
patient had a recent bypass graft on the right and it was found
that to have gone down.  Vascular surgery was consulted.  Per
their note: ""There does not appear to be any acute
limb-threatening ischemia of the R foot.  There is no evidence
of RLE infection as the cause of her hyperglycemia or altered
mentalstatus.""  A follow up appointment was arranged with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].
.
ACCESS: Access was difficult to obtain.  Pt needed RIJ placed.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32675**] is a 64 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension,
and chornic thrombocytopenia who initially presented to
[**Hospital1 **]
with a two day history of falls and dysarthria and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when she was found to have a right
basal
ganglia hemorrhage in the setting of a platelet count of 43.
.
The patient explains that she last felt well on Friday, two days
prior to admission.  One day prior to admission she started
falling; she thinks that she generally fell toward the left.
Although there was no loss of consciousness, she did strike her
head during at least one of the spills.  She also started to
drop
items from her left hand.   On the evening prior to admission,
she reportedly sent her friend a non-sensical email with letters
strung together in non- English words.  On the day of admission,
the patient's friend called her to see how she was faring and
discovered the patient's speech was slurred.  Accordingly, the
friend called 911.  The patient was initially taken to
[**Hospital1 **].
After a non-contrast CT of the head demonstrated right basal
ganglia hemorrhage, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and care.

the midline structures and mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle, not significantly changed compared to the recent CT
study. Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left
parietal lobe, corresponding to the previously noted hemorrhage
on the CT.


2. 5 x 5 mm saccular, lobulated aneurysm in the region of the
confluence of the A1 and A2 segment sof the right anterior
cerebral artery and the anterior communicating artery. However,
it is unclear if this has ruptured given the farther location of
the hematoma. hence, any other aneurysms or vascular lesions
cannot be completely excluded. Consider CT angiogram of the head
for better assessment of this aneurysm and any other
anuerysms/vascular lesions elsewhere and in the hematoma. Rec.
INR consult. Post-contrast MR images can be considered after
resolution of the hemorrhage to exclude an underlying mass
lesion. Findings informed to [**Doctor Last Name **] by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2200-7-22**].

3. Diffuse mucosal thickening/fluid in the left mastoid air
cells.

I7/26/10 US abd.
MPRESSION:
  1. Chronic appearing nonocclusive thrombus involving the
distal splenic
vein/SMV confluence with regions of presumed chronic occlusion
involving
portions of the main portal vein which is diminutive in size.
Some
intrahepatic right portal flow is noted which may relate to
arterial portal shunting or portal collateral vessel formation.
Hepatic veins and arteries remain patent.

2. Mild splenomegaly. Coarsened heterogeneous liver parenchyma
is presumably secondary to hepatitis C.

TTE [**2200-7-21**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32675**] is a 64 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including hepatitis C, pulmonary hypertension,
and chronic thrombocytopenia who initially presented to
[**Hospital1 **]
with a two day history of falls and dysarthria and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when she was found to have a right
basal
ganglia hemorrhage in the setting of a platelet count of 43.
You were admitted to the ICU where you had an uncomplicated
course while further workup was made to understand the etiology
of your bleed. You had platlet infusion while in the the ICU.
You had an MRI, TTE, CT head, CXR. You were observed in the ICU
and you had a stable course only requiring frequent close
observation. Your major deficits were imbalance, left hand/arm
numbness and weakness, and dysarthria/dysphagia with a left
facial droop. You were transferred to the floor for further
observation. You had a brief episode of hypotension which
responded to fluid. And we held your anti-hypertensive
medications because of this. Your SBP ranged from the mid 90's
to the 110's. You were evaluated by PT /OT who thought it was
safe for your to return home with home PT/OT and home health aid
which was requested. A call was made to your daughter [**Name (NI) 402**]
to arrange for some supervision while the above home health aid
could be arranged. You and [**Doctor Last Name 402**] stated that it would be best
if the appointments requested were to be made by [**Doctor Last Name 402**] since
she would be the one responsible for transportation. The
etiology of your hemorrhagic stroke is unknown but thought not
to be from hypertension but possibly from platlet dysfunction Vs
amyloid angiopathy.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for having a right basal ganglion bleed that
was discovered at an outside hospital. You had thrombocytopenia
and because of the bleed were given platlet infusion. You had an
troponin bump that was thought to be from cardiac stress but
given bleeding episode along with previous chronic intercranial
pathology consistent with a previous bleed you were not
anticoagulated or placed on aspirin. You have multiple serious
comorbidiites and we contact[**Name (NI) **] your outpatient specialist. You
were borderline hypotensive in the 90-110's systolic. Because of
this we held your aldactone and lasix and while metoprolol 12.5
mg was tried this was stopped because this had an adverse effect
on your blood pressure. We have asked you to stop these

PRE BYPASS The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being a paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. The thoracic aorta appears
intact. No changes from the prebypass study.
Radiology Report CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of
[**2133-4-18**]
Final Report
HISTORY: CABG. PICC line placement.
There is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent
with
atelectasis or consolidation. The costophrenic sulci are
blunted.
Mediastinal structures are unchanged. A right internal jugular
sheath remains in place. A PICC line has been inserted on the
left and terminates at the level of the cavoatrial junction.
Compared with the previous study
retrocardiac density has increased and blunting of the
costophrenic sulci is new or more apparent.
IMPRESSION: PICC placement as described. Increased atelectasis
or
consolidation in the lower left lung. Evidence for small pleural
effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111**] was a same day admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-4-15**] for
coronary artery bypass grafting. She was taken to the operating
room where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to
three vessels. Please see operative note for details.
In summary she had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to
the first obtuse marginal coronary artery; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from the aorta to the posterior left
ventricular coronary artery.
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.
Her bypass time was 78 minutes with a crossclamp time of 63
minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and post-operatively she was
transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. In the
immediate post-op period she remained hemodynamically stable,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Because the patient is a type 1 diabetic followed by the [**Last Name (un) 387**]
diabetes service they were consulted for assistance in her care
and insulin management. The patient stayed in the ICU for 3
additional days because she required a Phenylephrine infusion to
support her blood pressure. On POD4 she transferred out of the
ICU to the stepdown floor for continued care and recovery from
her surgery. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed.
She was seen by physical therapy and her activity was advanced.
The remainder of her hospital course ws uneventful. On POD6 the
patient was discharged home with visiting nurses. she is to
follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in 4 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 43 yo M with h/o DMI here with hyperkalemia, DKA and groin
ulcer.
.
# Hyperkalemia: This occured in the setting of being on AceI.
Lisinopril held and K trended down to normal. F/U with pcp
regarding restarting lisinopril.
.
# ARF: Cr at the OSH was 2.1. He is down to 1.2 and his baseline
is 1.3-1.6. UA negative. Was probably pre-renal in setting of
DKA and dehydration. Improved with IVF further supporting
prerenal etiology. As blood pressure was normal while off
lisinopril and patient has had hyperkalemia with the lisinopril,
this medication was held and pt should f/u with pcp regarding
restarting this medication.
.
# DMI: Patient admitted to ICU for insulin gtt and IVF as he had
an anion gap [**1-18**] DKA, He had ketones in urine. Likely
precipitant of DKA was infection. Groin ulcer infected with
MSSA.  Patient was transitioned off insulin gtt and transferred
to floor where we resumed his home dose of insulin at 80 units
[**Hospital1 **]. We also continued asa, atorvastatin. He was set up with
[**Last Name (un) 387**] on discharge.

# Groin ulcer- Swab shows mixed flora and MSSA. Pt is s/p
debridement at bedside by general surgery. He was initially
treated with 5 days of IV vancomycin and was discharged on
dicloxacillin on discharge after sensitivities came back.
Dressings were changed [**Hospital1 **] and pt has VNA at home to help with
this. Patient given appointment for surgery follow-up on
discharge.
.
# Foot ulcers- podiatry followed the patient while he was in the
hospital and he has outpatient follow-up set up. Dressings
changed daily.
.
# Leg wounds: Vascular surgery follows these wounds. None of the
leg wounds appeared infected. Dressing changed daily by wound
care nurse. Pt has vascular surgery follow-up after discharge.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia- continued lipitor
.
# Neuropathy- continued neurontin-renally dosed at 300 q 6
hours.

MICROBIOLOGY:

[**2141-4-29**] Abscess aspirate: E. coli (pan-sensitive)

RADIOLOGY:

[**2141-4-28**] CT: There are no stones in the ureters or  urinary
bladder. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
There is a 7.3 x 5.4 cm fluid collection inferior to the cecum,
with adjacent fat stranding. The appendix is not visualized.
These findings likely represent ruptured appendicitis and
periappendiceal abscess. Small bowel loops are normal in
caliber.

[**2141-4-29**] CT: Successful placement of an 8-French self-locking
pigtail catheter within the periappendiceal abscess. The
catheter is open to drainage.

[**2141-5-6**] CT: drainage from JP


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 year old male who was admitted on [**2141-4-28**] with
several weeks of abdominal pain and a CT scan revealing an
appendiceal abscess. This was drained by interventional
radiology on [**2141-4-29**] and an 8-french catheter was left in place.
The patient was toxic-appearing on admission with tachycardia
and low oxygen saturation. He also had an INR of 10 and was on
coumadin at home for peripheral vascular disease, but hadn't had
this checked regularly. He also had an elevated blood sugar of
500. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for management
of these multiple issues . His pain was well controlled with prn
morphine. From a respiratory standpoint, he was well-managed
with nasal cannula oxygen and did not require intubation but was
treated with nebulizers.  His blood sugars were managed
initially with an insulin drip which was then converted to
sliding scale insulin. He was started on empiric levoquin and
flagyl. Prior to the IR drainage, FFP was used to reverse his
elevated INR. He remained stable after his procedure and had no
bleeding complications. On hospital day three he was started
back on a clear diet which he tolerated well. He received lasix
diuresis for congestion in his lungs and edema with good
response. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for diabetes control and assisted
with transition to a sliding scale insulin. He was transfered to
the floor on hospital day 5 and started on a regular diet which
he tolerated well . His hematocrit trended downward although
there was no evidence of an active bleed and he was supported
with 2 units of packed red blood prodcuts on hospital day 5.
Pulmonology consult was obtained and assessed the patient as
having chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and felt he should
continue his home oxygen treatment and transition from
nebulizers here to combivent at home. He was restarted on his
home coumadin on hospital day 6 and was started on a heparin
drip. His INR level was 1.4 on day of discharge and he was
discharged with 5 mg QHS coumadin with planned blood level check
2 days after discharge and appropriate adjustment per PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] CT
scan was obtained on day of discharge which revealed no
remaining undrained abscesses, but his drain was left in place
with planned repeat CT scan within 2 weeks for assessment of any
new fluid collections before removal. He was transitioned off of
IV pain medications to oral pain medications as a discharge
regimen. A visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25472**] to assist with home drain
teaching. Cultures from his fluid aspirate revealed
pan-sensitive E. coli and he was discharged on a 10 day course
of augmentin. He will have follow-ups with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] as well
as [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes and his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] questions were answered to
his satisfaction upon discharge.

Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p stellate ganglion block


History of Present Illness:
67 y/o female with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (possibly
from myocarditis presumed viral >10 years ago) with LVEF of 20%
(non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on
recent echo), BiV ICD, who was admitted to CCU in late [**Month (only) 359**]
for VT ablation following ICD discharges in [**Month (only) **]. During
the procedure, it was found that she has multiple inducible VT's
arising from septum, lateral wall and apex. Ablation attempt not
performed given septal origin of VT. She was discharged home on
Mexiletine rather than Amiodarone. Following that discharge, she
continued to have frequent sustained VT, and was subsequently
readmitted [**10-22**] with more symptomatic VT which was paced and not
shocked. During that admission, she had an EP study and
attempted VT ablation at the anterior septal aspect of the
subaortic valve region. Carvedilol and Mexiletine were held
prior to the procedure. She was then started on Metoprolol and
titrated up to Metoprolol XL 50 mg PO BID. She was observed off
Mexiletine without further significant episodes and discharged
home on [**2114-10-25**].
.
This morning she was walking from her bathroom and felt
palpitations with associated lightheadedness for approximately
30 seconds. Her ICD subsequently fired and then fired again 30
seconds later. Her palpitations resolved
She was observed while she was off the mexiletine with no
significant episodes and sent home [**2114-10-25**]. This AM, she was
walking from her bathroom and felt palpitations and
lightheadedness for approximately 30 seconds. Her ICD fired, and
then fired again 30 seconds later. After the second shock, she
was no longer sympatomatic from her palps. She denied chest
pain/pressure, SOB, nausea during this episode.
.
She was instructed to present to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival, EP
interrogated the device which showed VT at a rate of ~120 BPM,
which was attempted to be broken by ATP twice and ultimately
shocked twice with escalating joules. On arrival to the floor,
she initially felt well without any palpitations or
lightheadedness. She subsequently developed VT to 110s-120s. She
then received Ativan 1 mg IV and Lidocaine 100 mg IV once at
1400 with subsequent resolution of her VT. At 1755 she again
went into VT and recevied Metoprolol 5 m IV once and an
additional 50 mg IV Lidocaine. This episode resolved as well but
40 minutes later she again went into VT and received Fentanyl 25
mg IV and Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The VT again resolved but the
patient was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient was calm and was no longer
in VT. She felt well only reporting a fluttering in her chest
when in VT.

STRESS EKG
INTERPRETATION: This 67 year old woman with LVEF of 20% and
history
of dilated cardiomyopathy and VT was referred to the lab for
evaluation.
The patient exercised for 4.5 minutes of a modified [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]/RAMP

protocol and asked the test be stopped for fatigue. The
estimated peak
MET capacity was 1.5 which represents a poor functional
capacity. No
arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient
throughout the study. The ST segments are uninterpretable for
ischemia
in the setting of the v-paced rhythm. The rhythm was a-v paced
with
rare isolated vpbs. Resting hypotension with a slight increase
in
systolic BP with exercise.
IMPRESSION: No symptoms or sustained ectopy with uninterpretable
ST
segments at the achieved level of exercise.


Brief Hospital Course:
67-year-old woman with an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with
LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation
(improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, recent study for
endocardial/epicardial ablation of multifocal VT that were found
to arise from septum, lateral wall and apex, recently ablated
[**2114-10-25**]. Discharged on toprol XL. Now presenting with recurrent
VT and shocks x2.
.
ACTIVE ISSUE:
# Ventricular tachycardia: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a succesful
stellate ganglion block. After this procedure she did not have
any episodes of VT demonstrating a significant smpathetic
component to her VT. She was also started on Quinidine. She will
follow up with EP to decide on the long term plan as the
stellate ganglion block is not expected to permanently suppress
her arrhythmia.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Chronic, LVEF 20%. NY Class III/IV per

outpt notes which has worsened recently from II. On CHF regimen
including carvedilol, spironolactone, and torsemide.
.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.7 on admission
and trended down to 1.4 on discharge. This appears to be her
baseline per our records.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral Central Venous Line


History of Present Illness:
28 yo F with a history of DM1 c/b gastroporesis presents with
severe abdominal pain. Patient is noncompliant and reportedly
only occasionally takes her BP medications and only some of her
insulin at baseline. Per report, patient was screaming at the
top of her lungs at triage that she had abdominal pain in all 4
quadrants which started upon waking in the morning. This was
associated with nausea and vomitting. She did note missing HD
for the last 2 sessions.
.
In the ED, she was found to have an Anion gap of 25,
hyperglycemia and ketonuria. She was strarted on an Insulin drip
at 7U/hr. She also received 1 L NS, 3 mg of IV Dilaudid, 1mg IV
ativan, 8mg IV Zofran, and 10 mg IV compazine. She was also
given Calcium gluconate for a K of 5.3 and peaked T waves on
EKG. She was hypertensive to ths 190s and was given her PM dose
of labetalol 100 mg po x1. 1 EJ and 2 IJs were attempted
unsuccessfully, so a femoral line was placed. Per nursing notes,
she was noted to be ""sleepy but arousable"" during the repeated
line placements. Repeat FS at 2220 was 71, so Insulin was
reduced to 5 u/hr and D51/2 NS with 20 meq K was started after a
D50 bolus. On transfer, VS were afebrile, 93, 133/86, 14, 96%
RA.
.
On the floor, she is lethargic and barely arousable to sternal
rub. She can tell me she came in with abdominal pain, but then
nods back to sleep. She can not answer orientation questions.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 28 year old female with DM1 and ESRD on HD presenting
with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
.
# Diabetic ketoacidosis-- The patient presented with an anion
gap acidosis (anion gap of 25), glucose of 301, and ketonuria.
The precipitant for the diabetic ketoacidosis was at first
unclear, but after discharge the patient's urine culture
returned positive for enterococcus.  She was called at home and
a prescription for Augmentin 500mg daily was called in for her
to take after her dialysis session.  She was started on IV
insulin without a bolus in the ED and continued on an insulin
drip at 5U /hr with Q1hr finger sticks.  Her anion gap drifted
down to 13 and blood sugar to 96.  She was also treated with D5
1/2 NS with 20meq K, with frequent electrolyte checks for
hyperkalemia given her end stage renal disease.  She was
transitioned to subcutaneous insulin on hospital day 2.  She was
followed by [**Last Name (un) **] and discharged on Lantus 12 units at bedtime
and a Humalog ISS.
.
#. UTI: The patient had a benign UA but had >100,000 colonies of
enterococcus growing in her urine on a urine culture which was
finalized after the patient was discharged.  This is the likely
cause of her DKA and the patient was called as an outpatient and
treated with Augmentin 500mg daily after HD sessions.
.
# Altered mental status:  The patient received benzodiazepines
and narcotics in the ED and was noted to be ""sleepy"" during
numerous line attempts, but was apparently awake and oriented at
triage.  There was concern for cerebral edema in the setting of
over-correction of serum osms, but a CT head was negative.
.
# Abdominal pain: The patient carries the diagnosis of
gastroporesis, which may be etiology of her pain as she did
present with nausea and vomitting.  She responded to dilaudid,
ativan, and compazine in the ED.  Her lipase was normal and alk
phos was elevated, but other LFTs were normal.  Her exam was
benign.
.
# ESRD on HD:  She had missed several consecutive HD sessions
prior to admission.  She has a fistula for access and still has
good residual UOP. She was continued on sensipar and HD was
reinitiated as an inpatient.
.
#. Hypertension.  Her home regimen of clonidine, lisinopril, and
labetalol was continued.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD who
presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting found to be
hyperkalemic
.
# Hyperkalemia: She was found to be hyperkalemic with EKG showig
peaked T-waves after missing at least two sessions of
hemodialysis. She was given insulin, D50, calcium gluconate and
hemodialysis was pursued. The renal team was consulted. Her
lisinopril was initially held.  Her hemodialysis was completed
uneventfully.
.
# ESRD on HD: She underwent emergent hemodialysis following
placement of the temporary catheter in the emergency department.
The renal team was consulted.  She was continued on sevelemer. A
social work consult was placed given history of missed
hemodialysis sessions.
.
# Somnolence: Likely due to administration of morphine and
droperidol in setting of ESRD as was reportedly mentating at
baseline initially on ED arrival. Her mental status quickly
improved and sedating medications were avoided.
.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: AG = 16. [**Month (only) 116**] have degree of
uremia. With abd pain, concern for lactic acidosis although pt
unlikely to have ischemic bowel, especially given benign exam.
Glucose level not c/w DKA.  Her lactates and electrolytes were
monitored.  Her anion gap resolved without intervention.
.
# RUQ pain/N/V: Per ED history, symptoms typical of
gastroparesis. Has had similar pain in past with DKA
presentation but labs not consistent with this today. Alk phos
elevated but other LFTs nl, c/w prior labs. Lipase nl. Pt
currently without TTP on exam s/p morphine although somnolent.
N/V could occur in setting of uremia although BUN only 41.

Her abdominal exam remained benign throughout the admission.

# Hypertension: Initially very high on presentation, likely due
to pain.  Improved with pain control.  Her anti-hypertensives
were initially held in the setting of GI bleed (see below), but
labetalol and clonidine were restarted at her home doses prior
to discharge.
Her lisinopril was initially held in the setting of acute renal
failure.
.
# Diabetes Type I: Her fingersticks were initially low in the
setting of receiving insulin for hyperkalemia. She was given one
amp of D50 with improvement in blood sugars. She was restarted
onher home insulin regimen of 12 lantus Qhs and insulin sliding
scale.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: She was recently found to have a RLL
subsegmental PE on [**2101-4-25**]. Her INR was initially therapeutic.
She was continued on coumadin 4mg q 4pm until her episode of
maroon stool described below.  At that time, risks and benefits
of anticoagulation were weighed, and her coumadin was held.  Her
anticoagulation was not able to be restarted prior to the
patient leaving the hospital against medical advice.

# Marked Hematocrit Drop:  Patient was noted to have hematocrit
drop from 30 to 17.  The patient had oozing from right femoral
line site after its discontinuation for 1-2 days, as well as her
usual menses.  She was also noted to have maroon stool.  She was
transferred to the ICU where she received 2 units of FFP and 2
units of pRBCs.  Her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 25 and
then continued to rise towards 28.  No further episodes of
bleeding were noted, and her hematocrit remained stable.

GI was consulted and stated they would likely perform a
colonoscopy after the patient has been stabilized and returned
to the regular medical floor.  Unfortunately, the patient left
the hospital against medical advice prior to her tranfer to the
floor.

On the evening of discharge, the patient became very tearful and
upset regarding her length of hospitalization.  She expressed
her wishes to the leave the hospital against medical advice.

A long discussion was had with the patient by the intern,
resident, and attending physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 35230**].  The risks of
leaving the hospital, including infection, continued bleeding,
and death were discussed with the patient.  She verbalized
understanding of these risks after which she signed a discharge
against medical advice form.

Her PICC line was removed and the patient left the hospital.  An
email was sent to her PCP informing her of these events.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year old woman with hx of mixed cardiomyopathy
with EF 20-25% s/p AICD placement, CAD s/p PCI to RCA, diabetes,
hypertension and afib on warfarin. She presented from nursing
home s/p fall out of bed after which she hit her head. She
reportedly vomited shortly thereafter. Nursing home staff put
her back into bed, and she was later noted to be unresponsive.
Nursing home staff felt she had no pulses and initiated chest
compressions; however, when EMS arrived, patient was noted to
have pulses. EMS intubated patient at the scene and sent her to
outside hospital, where she had Head CT negative for bleed. She
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
.
[**8-26**]-admitted for N/V and RLQ pain at OSH, found to have E.coli
sepsis [**3-17**] UTI, treated with Augmentin and d/c'ed amiodarone
during that admission. Of note, CT head w/o contrast was neg.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were as follows: 60 109/65 17 100%
vent: TV 500, rate 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%. Exam notable for being
combative, roving horizontal eye movements but not following
commands(on sedation). Labs notable for Hct 35.6, WBC 14,
troponin of 0.16, creatinine of 0.16 and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 31100**]. Blood gas
as follows: 7.52/41/391/35 on CMV(FiO2 100%, Vt 450cc, RR 14,
PEEP 5). EKG was significant for prolong QT.
.
She was noted to be hypotensive to 70 in the ED with wide
complex polymorphic tachycardia at 200 beats/min which
subsequently degenerated into ventricular fibrillation
terminated by ICD shock x 2. She again went into wide complex
tachycardia with no pulse requiring one round of CPR. She
underwent another similar episode requiring CPR and external
shock at 200 [**Doctor First Name **] with ROSC. She was started initially given
amiodarone bolus but was switched to lidocaine bolus + gtt with
concern for torsades from prolong QT vs ischemic polymorphic
wide complex tachycardia. She was given 2 grams of magnesium, 40
meq of potassium and transferred to CCU. Cardiac arrest/Cooling
team was not called per ED team as her cardiac arrest were brief
at OSH and here.
.
On the floor, she is intubated.

Studies
Admission EKG [**2123-9-8**]: A-V sequential pacemaker. It is likely
the pacemaker is set with a long P-R interval. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2112-7-4**] the rhythm appears to be
atrio-ventricular paced on the current tracing.

TTE [**2123-9-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The coronary
sinus is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
akinesis of the septal and inferior walls and global hypokinesis
of the remaining walls. The basal inferolateral wall is
relatively preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters
are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe regional
and global biventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation. Small to moderate circumferential
pericardial effusion. Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior report (images unable to be reviewed) of
[**2112-7-4**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
The pericardial effusion is larger.
.
CT Head w/o Contrast [**2123-9-8**]: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction. Ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and in configuration.  The mastoid air
cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
.
CXR AP [**2123-9-8**]: An endotracheal tube ends at the level of the
clavicular heads, 5.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube
ends with the tip just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
This tube could be advanced by 5-10 cm. Note is made of a
dual-lead pacer/AICD device. A left neck IV catheter is noted,
with the tip not positioned within any identifiable large
vessel. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and note is made of
a dense left lower lobe opacity. Note is also made of mild
pulmonary
vascular congestion.
.
CXR AP [**2123-9-15**]: Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in the
standard position in the right atrium and right ventricle.
Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There is no evident pneumothorax.
Right PICC remains in place. Small right pleural effusion has
increased. Small left pleural effusion and bibasilar
atelectasis, left greater than right, have increased on the
right. Pulmonary edema has improved.
.
Echo [**2123-9-24**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed
jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2123-9-8**], the mitral regurgitation is reduced. The left
ventricular ejection fraction is similar.

.
#MONOMORPHIC VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION ARREST
The cause of VT is likely secondary to a degrading rhythm
centered around a scar from her previous RCA myocardial
infarction in [**2112**] versus toxicity with digoxin as level
returned at 2.  Other possibilities include inherited prolonged
QT.  Cardiac troponins peaked at .21.
      Patient was initially on levofed and a lidocaine drip.
Both these medications were discontinued after the first day
without incident and patient was briefly treated with
amiodarone.  Patient did endorse some chest pain during
admission, but this was centered around her ribs and is likely
due to compressions.  The pain resolved with lidocaine patches
and occasional vicodin.
      With regards to the AICD, the device was reprogrammed with
pAVI 120msec, [**Last Name (un) **] 100msec, HR=80 to improve the patient's
diastolic heart failure.  Additionally, the reprogrammed VT
therapy to VT detection ON at 150bpm with ATP x3 followed by 3
shocks at 25J, 36J, 36J. She was successfully transferred to the
floor on hospital day 6.
      Given the patient's severe MR, and low EF was likely
exacerbated by the dyssynchronous rhythm, therefore it was
determined the patient would likely benefit from placement of an
epicardial lead versus another attempt at placement via a
coronary sinus approach (prior attempt resulted in unroofing of
left coronary sinus). EP felt that the patient was a candidate
for endovascular placement of a left ventricular lead.
Therefore she had a biventricular
pacemaker upgrade on [**2123-9-23**] and tolerated the procedure well.
Repeat echocardiogram showed similar ejection fraction and
improvement in her mitral regurgitation.
.
#Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure
Patient with history of cardiomyopathy with EF of 15-20% from
[**2123-9-8**].  Patient was edematous upon admission and started on a
Lasix drip at 10mg/hr.  She was diuresed initially with lasix
then with torsemide and metolazone with improvement in her
respiratory status and edema. However diuretics were
discontinued due to rising creatinine. With improvement in her
renal function she was discharged on home torsemide.   Patient's
oxygen requirement was at her baseline at the time of discharge.

.
#UROSEPSIS
Patient was recently admitted for E.coli sepsis at an outside
hospital and discharged on oral amoxicillin. When patient
represented to this hospital, she was hypotensive, likely due to
decreased volume, but there was concern for ongoing sepsis.
Patient was initially treated with vanc/ zosyn/ flagyl and
initially narrowed to cefepime, with final dose given [**2123-9-12**]
for a total of 2 weeks antibiotic therapy following diagnosis of
the urosepsis.
     Blood cultures from admission showed no growth and WBC
ranged from 6.5 to 14 and patient was afebrile throughout
admission. ID was consulted who felt there were no signs or
symptoms concerning for infection.
.
# Elevated creatinine:
Over the course of admission patients creatinine trended upward.
 This was felt to be due to a combination of diuresis in
addition due to her poor ejection fraction.  This is expected to
improve now that she had undergone BiV upgrade.  At the time of
discharge her creatinine was trending down.
.
# Hx atrial fibrillation: Patients home coumadin was held for
her lead placement.  This was restarted prior to discharge. At
the time of discharge her INR was 1.3. Her home coreg was
changed to metoprolol due to hypotension. Additionally she was
restarted on PO amiodarone.
.
# Depression-  The patient was noted to have low mood throughout
her hospital stay.  She was seen by social work who offered her
support in terms of dealing with her illness.  Additionally her
home celexa was increased from 20 to 30 mg.
.
#CONDYLOMA ACCUMINATTA
Bilateral and extending 6 inches along perianal region.
Monitored throughout admission with consideration of involving
dermatology/ surgery in the future.
.
# Hypertension: Pt was hypotensive during hospitalization so
antihypertensives were initially held.  At the time of discharge
her home anti-hypertensives were restarted with the exception of
coreg which was changed to metoprolol.
#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization
- Patient will have follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiology on

You also had an acute exacerbation of your congestive heart
failure and needed lasix intravenously to take off the extra
fluid. Your ICD settings were adjusted. As your heart function
is so weak, it will be helpful to change your pacemaker function
to a biventricular mode. This will require the addition of
another pacemaker lead and we hope to do this on Thursday [**9-23**].
You will need to weigh yourself every day and call [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31102**] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or
5 pounds in 3 days. Your weight as discharge is 144 pounds.
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. WE changed your carvedilol to metoprolol succinate to lower
your heart rate
2. We changed your furosemide to torsemide to better prevent
fluid overload.
3. Discontinue digoxin
4. Increase celexa to 30 mg to better treat your depression
5. Start amiodarone again to treat your ventricular tachycardia
6. Start cephalexin for 6 days to prevent an infection at your
ICD site.

Chief Complaint:
Decreased vision in left eye

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 35 year-old male with a history of hypertension
(not currently on medication) who presents with blurry vision in
his left eye. The patient was in his usual state of good health
until 2 weeks prior to admission, when his left eye developed
darkness in the center of the visual field and blurriness in the
peripheral visual field. Over the following two weeks, the
patient reports no improvement or worsening of the blurriness.
On the day of admission, the patient visited his PCP for
evaluation of vision, and blood pressure was found to be
264/160. The patient was given lasix (20 mg, PO) and Aspirin
(325 mg, PO) and sent by ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient denies
dizziness, headache, changes in speech, motor deficits, tingling
or numbness, back pain, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of
breath, recent drug use, or consumption of wine/aged cheese. The
patient reports an increase in his dietary salt intake during
the 2-3 weeks prior to admission.
.
In the ED, the patient was in NAD, with T 98.4 P 100 BP 235/154
RR 18 SaO2 100 (RA). He was found to have optic disc swelling
and macular edema in his left eye. He denied CP, SOB, N/V/D. His
neuro exam was reported as normal. An EKG showed ST depression
in II,III, avf, with non-elevated cardiac enzymes. BUN/Cr
returned as 22/1.7 (baseline 1.1 from 3/[**2126**]). A CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no volume overload. CT head showed no acute
hemorrhage. He received a total of 5 L fluid in the ED. He was
started on a nitroprusside drip, and was changed to labetalol.
BP improved to 199/125 and vision improved (not back to normal),
and the patient was transferred to the ICU for further
evaluation and treatment.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he was in NAD. T 94.4 P 95 BP 192/109

[**2129-1-18**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with

stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 35 year-old male with history of hypertension, who
presents to the ED with left eye blurriness, BP 264/160, and
clinical picture consistent with Hypertensive Emergency. The
patient reports an increased salt intake during the days
preceeding onset of visual blurriness.
.
# Hypertensive Emergency: Symptoms of headache and vision
changes resolved on the medical floor. No evidence of
intracranial bleed of cardiac ischemia as a result of
hypertensive episode. Patient does have elevated creatinine
likely the result of elevated blood pressures. Blood pressure is
now better controlled. Presume poorly controlled primary HTN as
etiology but considered secondary causes given profound HTN in a
young man. Renal artery stenosis was ruled out by ultrasound and
MRI. No evidence of rib notching on CXR to suggest coarctation.
Urine and serum tox screens are negative making
intoxication/sympathomimetics a less likely cause of patient's
extreme blood pressures. Obstructive sleep apnea unlikely. TSH
is wnl (hyperthyroid is unlikely).  Patient was started on
amlodipine 10mg, HCTZ 25mg, and lisinopril 10mg daily.  Blood
pressure responded and fell to < 150/90 at the time of
discharge. Nutrition and social work were consulted to discuss
life style changes and the challenges of starting new medical
regimens.  Patient may benefit from follow up with a dietician
and social worker. [**Name (NI) **] is instructed to follow up with his
primary care provider within three days of discharge to have his
blood pressure monitored and his regimen tailored.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine of presentation 1.7 (baseline
1.1 from 3/[**2126**]). Most likely primary hypertension leading to
renal failure rather than the reverse. ACEI were initially held
until creatinine was trending down.  Creatinine fell to 1.3 with
IVF. However, Patient experienced increased creatinine (2.0)
after simultaneously starting HCTZ and lisinopril.  Doses were
adjusted and creatinine was trending down at the time of
discharge.  Patient is instructed to follow up with his primary
care provider within three days of discharge to have his renal
function monitored on his new antihypertensive regimen.  Patient
schedule for an appointment with renal in outpatient setting to
establish care for likely underlying chronic renal
insufficiency.
.
# Blurry Vision: Seen by Opthomology in Emergency Department.
Described as hypertensive fundus changes - severe with optic
nerve swelling and macular edema. Recommended BP control and to
call if vision worsens. Presumed manifestation of hypertensive
emergency.  Patient vision returned to baseline at time of
discharge.  Patient is schedule follow up with outpatient
ophthalmology.
.
# Anemia: Likely dilutional as Hct fell from 43 on admission to
33 overnight with the administration of 5 L IVF. No apparent
bleeding. Patient asymptomatic.  Hct trended up after initial
IVF bolus to 39.7 at the time of discharge.
.
# EKG changes: ST depression in leads II, III, AVF. Likely
cardiac strain in setting of hypertension. Non-elevated
troponin. Normal CK-MB. No chest pain.

CT head [**2120-12-7**]:
FINDINGS:  There is a focal linear region of hyperattenuation
measuring 8 mm
in greatest dimension within the periventricular white matter
and involving
the lateral margin of the right internal capsule consistent with
acute
hemorrhage.  There is a smaller adjacent focus.  No significant
mass effect is
present.  The major intracranial cisterns are preserved.  There
is no
hydrocephalus.

No acute fracture is detected.  The paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells
are clear except for mild mucosal thickening in the left
maxillary sinus.

IMPRESSION:

Two linear foci of hyperattenuation within the right corona
radiata
consistent with an acute parenchymal hemorrhage.  No significant
mass effect
or midline shift is demonstrated.

MRI/MRA head [**2120-12-7**]:
Comparison is made with CT head on the same day and from MRI,
MRA performed
[**2121-4-22**] and [**2120-8-16**].

There is mucosal thickening and mucous retention cyst in the
left maxillary
sinus.

Acute hemorrhages are again noted in the right corona radiata,
unchanged from
the previous CT.  There is no significant surrounding edema, or
mass effect.
There is no associated diffusion restriction.  There is no
enhancement to
suggest an underlying lesion.  There is lack of flow related
enhancement in
the left petrous and cavernous ICA and in the right supraclinoid
ICA.  This is
unchanged from the prior report.  There are multiple scattered
subcortical and
periventricular hyperintensities which likely represent small
vessel ischemic
sequela in this patient with diabetes.

IMPRESSION:

Small foci of hemorrhage in the right corona radiata with
minimal surrounding
edema and no midline shift.

Probable small vessel ischemic sequela related to underlying
diabetes in the
subcortical and periventricular white matter.

Lack of normal flow voids in the left petrous, cavernous and
supraclinoid ICA
and the right supraclinoid ICA, reportedly unchanged from prior
examination.

Images from the previous MRI from [**2120-8-16**] are pending at this
time.

ECG [**2120-12-7**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave progression, probably a normal
variant.
Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2121-6-23**] there is no significant diagnostic change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Given the patient's severe hypertension in the setting of
hemorrhage, the patient was admitted to ICU for BP control.  Her
blood pressure was quickly controlled in the unit, and she was
called out to the floor for further management and observation.
MRI of the head showed a stable bleed, with no underlying mass
or vascular anomaly as the source for the right corona radiata
bleed.  It also revealed stable (previously known) 100% left ICA
occlusion and an occlusion in the right supraclinoid ICA.  Risk
stratification showed an A1C of 10.3 and a fasting lipid profile
with LDL 77 and HDL 65 while on lipitor 80 mg/d and zetia 10 mg
qod.

She was transferred out of the ICU to the floor on [**12-8**] and
observed for 24 hours.  Overall, her exam had improved: she was
found to have left arm 5-/5 UMN pattern weakness (deltoid and
triceps, full distally) with pronator drift, and full strength
in the left leg, though still with a wide-based, slightly
cautious gait, favoring the right side.  She was evaluated by PT
and OT and felt to be safe to go home with outpatient PT/OT.
She was restarted on her home dose of aspirin in addition to the
[**Month/Day (4) 4532**], considering her prior history, and the intracranial
hemorrhage was ultimately felt to be related to elevated ICP
with coughing, coupled with hypertension.

Cardiac Cath [**2186-10-27**] 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed 3 vessel and left main disease
unsuitable for PCI. The LMCA had an 80% stenosis distally at the
bifurcation of the LAD and LCX. The LAD had mild disease in the
previously placed proximal stent and moderate mid-segment
disease. The LCX had an 80% ostial stenosis with an 80% stenosis
proximally in a high OM1. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the
mid-segment and an 80% stenosis in the proximal right
posterolateral branch. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
severely elevated systemic arterial pressure despite a
nitroglyercine IV drip with an SBP of 181 mm Hg. The LVEDP was
also elevated at 25 mm Hg suggestive of severe diastolic
dysfunction. There was no gradient suggestive of aortic stenosis
with pullback across the aortic valve. 3. Left ventriculography
given renal insufficiency.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

ECHO [**2186-10-27**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Prominent symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Dilated thoracic aorta.
These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2179-6-22**], prominent left ventricular hypertrophy is now
identified.

[**2186-10-30**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST BYPASS:
Left and right ventricular function is preserved. The aorta is
intact. The study is unchanged.

[**2186-10-30**] Carotid Ultrasound
Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 29794**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   55 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

Final Report
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL
REASON FOR EXAM: Status post CABG, follow up effusion.
Since [**2186-11-1**], all tubes and catheters were removed
except right
internal jugular catheter ending into the cavoatrial junction.

Minimal bilateral pleural effusions are associated with small
left basilar
atelectasis. There is no volume overload. Lungs are otherwise
clear. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-10-27**] for
management of his dyspnea and chest pain. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which revealed severe left main
and three vessel coronary artery disease. Heparin, beta
blockade, a statin and aspirin were started. He ruled in for a
myocardial infarction by enzymes. Given the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no
significant internal carotid artery disease. On [**2186-10-30**], Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see
operative note for details. In summary he had a CABG x4 with
LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM,SVG-Diag,SVG-PDA. His bypass time was 113
minutes with a crossclamp of 90 minutes. He tolerated the
operation well and was transferred to the intensive care unit
for monitoring in stable condition. He did well in the immediate
postoperative period, however he did have a metabolic acidosis
and therefore remained intubated until the morning of POD1 at
6AM. He continued to do well and was transferred from the ICU to
the stepdown unit on POD2. The remainder of his post-operative
course was uneventful. Once on the floor his chest tubes and
epicardial wires were removed. His activity progressed and on
POD 4 he was discharged home with visiting nurses.

50 yo F with PMH of DM1, ESRD not on HD, gastroparesis, HTN who
presents with vomiting and altered mental status. Her husband
reports that their two sons have been sick this week with a
viral gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea). The patient has
not been feeling very well for the last couple of days. When he
left for work this morning, she was ""ok."" But he called to check
in on her and found that she had been vomiting. He came home and
brought her to the ED. He reports that she has been speaking
without making sense and he can't understand what she is saying.
He reports that she ""gets like this"" when her sugars are very
high or if she has high temperatures. She has been hospitalized
several times for hypotension, infections in her toes or hypo or
hyperglycemia. He denies that she had fevers at home. She did
not complain of CP, SOB, f/c, abdominal pain, headache or change
in vision at home.
.
In the ED, her BP in initially was 212/137, HR 110, O2sat 99%
and T 96.8. Her BS was 436 on arrival. She vomited coffee ground
emesis and received zofram, regular insulin 10 units,
hydralazine 10mg IV, protonix 40mg IV. NG lavage was attempted
several times without success. GI was notified and decided to
hold on scoping her until she was more stable unless her HCT
dropped. Her BS decreased to 318 with a AG of 16. She was given
more insulin and IVF. Her temperature spiked to 104 axillary.
BCx and UCx and LP were performed. She was also given levo,

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F with DM1, ESRD not on HD with hyperglycemia, n/v and
altered mental status in the setting of fevers to 104. She
initially was brought to the MICU for care for hypertenisve
urgency.
.
# altered mental status: The initially ddx included infection,
toxic metabolic, ingestion, hypertensive encephalopathy.  Her
CSF was clear and her cultures (blood, urine and CSF) were all
negative. Her toxic metabolic work up was negative including
RPR, TSH, B12, folate.  Her mental status cleared the next day
after controlling her blood pressure, so the likely diagnosis
was hypertensive encephalopathy. Her mental status throughout
the rest of her hospitalization was oriented times three and at
baseline.
.
# Fever/N/V/D: She had very high fevers on the first day of
admission up to 104 and was placed on a cooling blanket. She was
initially placed on vanco/zosyn for 48hrs until her cultures
were negative. The antibiotics were discontinued. She likely had
a viral illness similar to her family members.  Once transferred
to the medical floor she remained afebrile, tolerated a po diet
well.
.
# UGI bleeding: She had coffee ground emesis in ED and once in
the MICU on arrival. NG lavage could not be done (attempted
several times). Likely etiology was [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Last Name (un) 28726**] tear from
vomiting. GI was aware and given her other conditions, she was
not initially scoped. Her HCT remained stable and she was
continued on a PPI.  She should f/u with GI as an outpatient.
.
# hypertensive urgency: She was initially treated with a
labetolol gtt to control her blood pressures which were intially
over 200/100.  She was then tappered off and onto her home
medications of metoprolol and amlodipine. Her furosemide was
held given her rising Cr.  She will be discharged with
instructions of not to use her lasix until instructed by her
PCP.
.
# DM1: elevated BS in ED. Started on insulin gtt for concern for
mild DKA in setting of N/V/D. Mild ketoacids on labs. She was
transitioned to lantus and humalog with the help of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
diabetes consult. Her glargine was increased to 35, as was her
home sliding scale.  She will be discharged with glargin 35 and
her regular home sliding scale/
.
# ESRD: Patient's renal attending, Dr, [**Name (NI) **] saw patient rather
than renal consult and asked for renal c/s given slightly elev
Cr and potential need for HD soon. No acute need for HD (lytes
stable, euvolemic).  Her urine output was satisfactory on being
transferred to the floor.
.
# HTN: Patient off Labetolol gtt, and currently has been started
on Norvasc, Metoprolol and lasix.  Pt will be discharged on
Metoprolol and Norvasc at higher doses than her previous home
doses.
